[Intro]
[slide guitar]

[Verse]
Midnight in the workshop room
Screen glow cuts through the gloom
Instructor pulls back the curtain wide
Shows us what's inside
Not cold logic, not machine dreams
Millions of developers' screams
Stack traces and bug reports filed
Every error message compiled

[Chorus]
Training data midnight
Understanding the light
Not magic, not a ghost
Human wisdom we host
Every struggle, every fight
Fed the model through the night

[Verse 2]
QualityMinds walls hold the truth
AI learned from me and you
Failed builds and late night fixes
Coffee-stained documentation
Years of iteration
Our pain became its gain
Collective mind, shared brain

[Chorus]
Training data midnight
Understanding the light
Not magic, not a ghost
Human wisdom we host
Every struggle, every fight
Fed the model through the night

[Bridge]
[harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Now I see it clear as day
Standing at the crossroads way
Not afraid of what it knows
Built on how our garden grows
Every coder came before
Left their wisdom at the door

[Outro]
[whispered]
Midnight revelation
Collective foundation

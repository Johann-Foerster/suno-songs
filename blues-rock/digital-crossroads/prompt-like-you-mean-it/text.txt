[Intro]
[slide guitar]
Learning to speak in a brand new tongue

[Verse]
Sat down with the AI, thought I knew the way
Asked it vague questions, watched the answers stray
Code came back broken, logic all askew
Realized the problem wasn't it, was how I spoke too

[Chorus]
Gotta prompt like you mean it, baby
Be specific, be clear
The machine ain't psychic, maybe
Tell it what you want to hear
Communication's the key now
Just like it's always been somehow

[Verse]
Used to blame the algorithm when things went wrong
But good prompting's like writing a blues song
Context and details, that's what it needs
Plant the right seeds, watch your garden succeed

[Chorus]
Gotta prompt like you mean it, baby
Be specific, be clear
The machine ain't psychic, maybe
Tell it what you want to hear
Communication's the key now
Just like it's always been somehow

[Solo]
[guitar solo]

[Outro]
Found my voice in this digital age
Every good question turns a new page

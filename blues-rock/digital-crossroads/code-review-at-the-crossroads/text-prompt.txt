[Intro]
[slide guitar]

[Verse]
Standing at my pull request screen
Ay Eye's whispering what I should refactor clean
But my gut says something ain't quite right
Been coding long enough to know this fight

[Chorus]
At the crossroads, can't decide
Trust the machine or trust my pride
Sometimes the algorithm knows best
Sometimes I gotta fail my own test

[Verse]
Copilot says to change my nested loops
Suggests a pattern that could save the troops
But I remember when this pattern failed before
Machine don't know what I've been through before

[Chorus]
At the crossroads, can't decide
Trust the machine or trust my pride
Sometimes the algorithm knows best
Sometimes I gotta fail my own test

[Bridge]
[spoken, reflective]
Wisdom ain't choosing one or the other
It's knowing which voice to trust, brother
The crossroads teaches you to read the signs
When to follow, when to draw your lines

[Solo]
[extended guitar solo with Hammond organ]

[Outro]
Found my answer in the grey between
Human instinct meets the machine
That's the wisdom of the crossroads way
Choose wisely, code another day

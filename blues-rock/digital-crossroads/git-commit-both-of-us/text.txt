[Intro]
[slide guitar]
Two minds, one screen
Fingers on keys
Code flowing between

[Verse]
I write the logic, you see patterns I miss
Catching edge cases in the morning mist
At QualityMinds workshop, coding side by side
Your suggestions spark, I decide
Not replacement, just a different way
Human intuition meets machine array

[Chorus]
Git commit, both of us
Line by line we're building trust
My experience, your speed
Together writing what we need
Git commit, both of us
Collaboration or bust

[Verse 2]
I know the context, you search through time
Finding solutions in code sublime
Your patterns and my taste refine
Balance efficiency, keep it clean
Hammond swells when tests turn green
Best collaboration I've seen

[Chorus]
Git commit, both of us
Line by line we're building trust
My experience, your speed
Together writing what we need
Git commit, both of us
Collaboration or bust

[Bridge]
[harmonica]
Not the crossroads deal
This is something real
Neither one alone
Could have built this home

[Outro]
Pushing to main
Shared authorship plain
Git log shows the truth
Both our names in proof

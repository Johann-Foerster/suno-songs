[Intro]
[slide guitar]

[Verse]
Carrying legacy code, twenty years of patch and prayer
Nested loops and spaghetti, tangled everywhere
Then the ay eye looked inside, said this needs to change
Showed me patterns I could ride, time to rearrange

[Chorus]
Refactor my soul, clean up what's inside
Strip away the old, let the new be my guide
Like code that's running slow, filled with technical debt
Refactor my soul, ain't done changing yet

[Verse 2]
Machine said here's a better way, consolidate redundant lines
Extract methods, dee are why they say, optimize these designs
But it ain't just code, it's teaching me, it's how I lived
Holding onto history, afraid to give

[Chorus]
Refactor my soul, clean up what's inside
Strip away the old, let the new be my guide
Like code that's running slow, filled with technical debt
Refactor my soul, ain't done changing yet

[Bridge]
[harmonica solo]
Let go of the way it's always been
Fresh eyes see what I couldn't see within

[Outro]
Neural net and human sweat
Finding what I can't forget
Refactor my soul

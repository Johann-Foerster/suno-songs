[Intro]
[harmonica]

[Verse]
Seven Ay Em at QualityMinds headquarters
Coffee in my hand like armor
Twenty years of code my way
Not ready for this Ay Eye storm
They say it's gonna make me better
But I've heard that before
Got my Eye Dee Eee and old habits
Don't need no robot at my door

[Chorus]
Munich morning blues
Got these skeptic shoes
Can't take what I earned
Through bugs I've burned
Munich morning blues
Old school's what I choose
Let them have their brave new world
My fingers know the code unfurled

[Verse 2]
Conference room full of eager faces
Talking 'bout copilot dreams
Been down too many roads
Where shiny tools deceive
Built my craft from the ground
Every function tells a story
Now they want me trusting
Algorithm's hollow glory

[Chorus]
Munich morning blues
Got these skeptic shoes
Can't take what I earned
Through bugs I've burned
Munich morning blues
Old school's what I choose
Let them have their brave new world
My fingers know the code unfurled

[Bridge]
[slide guitar]
Workshop starts in fifteen
Pride and fear weighing heavy
Maybe just getting older
Maybe just not ready

[Outro]
Got my coffee, got my doubts
Standing at this crossroads now

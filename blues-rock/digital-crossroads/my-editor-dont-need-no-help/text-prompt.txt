[Intro]
[slide guitar]

[Verse]
Twenty years I've been typing these keys
Muscle memory flowing like the seas
Every semicolon placed just right
They say Ay Eye gonna do it clean
But my fingers know what's in between

[Chorus]
My editor don't need no help
I built this kingdom by myself
Autocomplete can't feel the flow
Of thirty thousand lines I know

[Verse 2]
Conference room at QualityMinds today
Workshop preaching the Ay Eye way
Neural net suggesting the fix
These hands debugged when crashes had no trace
Before machines could read my interface

[Chorus]
My editor don't need no help
I built this kingdom by myself
Autocomplete can't feel the flow
Of thirty thousand lines I know

[Bridge]
[harmonica]
Maybe I'm afraid they'll see
This expertise ain't what it used to be
Maybe I'm scared one day soon
My decades won't matter anymore

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
My editor don't need no help
Or maybe that's what I tell myself
Fighting change with every breath
Knowing something's gotta break

[Outro]
Twenty years of pride on the line
At the crossroads one more time

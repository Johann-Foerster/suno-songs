[Intro]
[harmonica]

[Verse]
Young blood at the keyboard, eyes bright with fear
Same look I wore when Vim first appeared
You think AI's different, gonna steal your throne
Kid, I said that about Stack Overflow back home

[Chorus]
Tools change but the struggle stays the same
Every generation plays a different game
IDE or chatbot, pencil or a pen
What matters is the craft, not where or when

[Verse 2]
Sat where you sit now, nineteen ninety-nine
Thought real coders wrote machine code line by line
Then came Eclipse, IntelliSense, and more
Each time the old guard swore we'd lost the core

[Bridge]
[slide guitar]
But the blues don't lie
Good code needs a human eye
AI's just your crossroads deal
The wisdom's knowing what is real

[Chorus]
Tools change but the struggle stays the same
Every generation plays a different game
IDE or chatbot, pencil or a pen
What matters is the craft, not where or when

[Outro]
[harmonica]
So take that co-pilot, learn to make it sing
The struggle ain't the tool, it's mastering the thing

[Intro]
[soulful guitar bends]

[Verse]
Midnight at the QualityMinds room, screen glowing bright
Ayy Eye suggests my next move before I've typed
Completes my functions, knows patterns by heart
But never earned these scars, never debugged in dark

[Chorus]
Pair programming with a ghost
Knows all answers, never paid the cost
Never pulled all-nighters hunting bugs
Never felt breakthrough when pieces fit snug
Coding with a ghost

[Verse 2]
Reads documentation faster than I see
Refactors functions with efficiency
Where's the struggle, earned wisdom deep?
Token predictions from patterns in heap

[Chorus]
Pair programming with a ghost
Knows all answers, never paid the cost
Never pulled all-nighters hunting bugs
Never felt breakthrough when pieces fit snug
Coding with a ghost

[Bridge]
[harmonica solo]
Maybe I'm just scared
Mastery ain't mine alone
Crossroads came too fast
Standing here unknown

[Outro]
At crossroads with machine beside me
Digital shadow feels inside me
Ghost in my Eye Dee Eee

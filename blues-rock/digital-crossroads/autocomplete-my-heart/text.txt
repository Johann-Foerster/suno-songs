[Intro]
[slide guitar]

[Verse]
Been staring at this function for three long days
Refactored twice, tangled in recursive maze
Fingers tired on the keys, coffee cold
Then that suggestion appears, calm and bold

[Verse 2]
AI says "try a map instead of nested loops"
Three lines collapse my twisted groups
Pattern recognition through my tired eyes
Machine sees clearly what pride won't recognize

[Chorus]
Autocomplete my heart, show what I missed
Every elegant solution I dismissed
Wounded pride and wonder side by side
Algorithm sees the path when vision's blind

[Bridge]
[Hammond organ swell]
Used to trust my intuition as the only way
But tired minds lead astray
Neural nets and training data flow
Finding patterns I was too close to know

[Chorus]
Autocomplete my heart, show what I missed
Every elegant solution I dismissed
Wounded pride and wonder side by side
Algorithm sees the path when vision's blind

[Outro]
[harmonica]
Reluctant admiration
Learning to let go
Machine and human wisdom
Together we grow

[Intro]
[slide guitar]
Highway lights blurring past
Autobahn stretching home at last

[Verse]
Left the workshop at sunrise, QualityMinds in my mirror
Code and coffee stains, everything feels clearer
Three days learning to trust what I couldn't see
Ay Eye partner riding shotgun, setting my doubts free

[Chorus]
Highway one-oh-one, digital road I'm on
Fear turned to partnership, skeptic's finally gone
Mile markers passing, showing how far I've come
From resistance to trust, the journey's just begun

[Verse 2]
Used to code alone, protecting every line
Now I've got a co-pilot, crossing that borderline
The machine suggests, I decide what's right
Two minds working together, coding through the night

[Chorus]
Highway one-oh-one, digital road I'm on
Fear turned to partnership, skeptic's finally gone
Mile markers passing, showing how far I've come
From resistance to trust, the journey's just begun

[Bridge]
[harmonica solo]
Dashboard glow reminds me
Of screens we shared back there
Not replacing, elevating
Human wisdom, silicon care

[Outro]
Road ahead looks different now
Same hands on the wheel somehow
Changed but still myself
Workshop wisdom, highway wealth

[Intro]
[harmonica solo]

[Verse]
Let the machine handle the mundane grind
Boilerplate code, repetitive lines
But quality lives in the human mind
Judgment and purpose, that's what defines
AI writes fast, formats it clean
But craftsmanship's more than what's seen

[Chorus]
Quality mind, machine hand
Working together, understand
The tool can't replace the plan
Quality mind, machine hand

[Verse 2]
Learned this truth at the crossroads here
Let go control, but keep vision clear
Machine suggests, but I still steer
Trust the assist, but trust my ear
QualityMinds showed me the way
Partner with power, don't push away

[Chorus]
Quality mind, machine hand
Working together, understand
The tool can't replace the plan
Quality mind, machine hand

[Bridge]
[organ swells]
Not replacement, just extension
Not surrender, collaboration
Human judgment makes the call
Machine precision builds it all

[Solo]
[electric guitar solo with Hammond organ]

[Chorus]
Quality mind, machine hand
Working together, understand
The tool can't replace the plan
Quality mind, machine hand

[Outro]
[slide guitar]
Found my balance at the crossroads tonight
Machine takes the burden, I hold the light

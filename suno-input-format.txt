**TITLE: Code Against the Machine**
**GENRE: Heavy Metal**
**STYLE: Aggressive, Dark, Progressive Exhaustion**

[Verse 1]
Fingers flying on the keyboard like lightning strikes
Ten thousand lines per minute, pushing through the night
I'm the master of my domain, ruler of the code
But there's something in the shadows, down this endless road

Arrays and functions dancing in my caffeine-fueled mind
Algorithms screaming as I leave the bugs behind  
I thought I was invincible, thought I ruled this game
But artificial thunder calls, and it knows my name

[Chorus]
CODE AGAINST THE MACHINE!
I'm fighting for my soul!
The silicon destroyer takes complete control!
FLESH VERSUS STEEL!
Nothing left that's real!
I'm coding till I'm bleeding but the AI cannot feel!

[Verse 2]
My eyes are burning crimson from the monitor's glow
Seventeen hours straight, but the pace is getting slow
The neural networks learning every move I make
While my mortal hands are trembling, feel my spirit break

Python strikes like venom, JavaScript attacks
C++ is crushing all the hope that my mind lacks
The machine is writing faster than my dreams can flow
In this digital battlefield, I'm the one to go

[Chorus]
CODE AGAINST THE MACHINE!
I'm fighting for my soul!
The silicon destroyer takes complete control!
FLESH VERSUS STEEL!
Nothing left that's real!
I'm coding till I'm bleeding but the AI cannot feel!

[Bridge]
I remember when I started, thought I'd change the world
Every bug was just a puzzle waiting to unfurl
Now the machine is thinking faster than I ever could
In this race of man versus AI, I'm misunderstood

My hands are getting slower!
My mind is getting weak!
The code is getting stronger!
It's everything I seek!
But I can't keep the pace up!
My human heart will break!
Against this digital monster, what difference can I make?

[Final Chorus - Defeated]
CODE AGAINST THE MACHINE!
I've lost my very soul!
The silicon destroyer has taken full control!
FLESH VERSUS STEEL!
The battle wasn't real!
I coded till I'm bleeding, now the AI is all I feel

[Outro]
Power failing, human falling
Code calling, AI crawling into everything
I surrender to the machine...

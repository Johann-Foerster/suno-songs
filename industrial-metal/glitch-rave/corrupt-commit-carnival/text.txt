[Intro]
[glitchy]
Git push at midnight
Something's wrong
Merge conflicts everywhere

[Verse]
One corrupt commit, master's gone insane
Carousel of errors spinning through the main
Clowns in the codebase, juggling NULL refs
Tightrope branches snapping, no safety nets left

[Chorus]
Corrupt commit carnival! [shouted]
Binary circus burns!
Ferris wheel exceptions
Watch the repo turn!
Neon calliope screaming
Through distorted riffs
Corrupt commit carnival
Reality's adrift!

[Verse]
Funhouse mirror diffs reflecting broken states
Rollercoaster stack trace through the data gates
Cotton candy syntax, melting into bytes
Ringmaster merge conflict under strobe lights

[Chorus]
Corrupt commit carnival! [shouted]
Binary circus burns!
Ferris wheel exceptions
Watch the repo turn!
Neon calliope screaming
Through distorted riffs
Corrupt commit carnival
Reality's adrift!

[Bridge]
[rapid-fire]
Revert! Revert!
But it's too late
Hard reset won't kill
This twisted fate

[Drop]
[instrumental with carnival organ and heavy guitar]

[Outro]
[whispered]
The show must go on
In this digital big top
Forever corrupted
The carnival won't stop

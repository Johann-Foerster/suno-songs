[Intro]
[alarm sounds]
Three AM, the monitors glow
Pipeline breaks, red status row

[Verse]
Slack notification screaming loud
Jenkins failed, alerts in the cloud
Logs spewing gibberish lines
Phantom errors, undefined signs
Stack trace pointing nowhere real
Hallucinated data reveal

[Chorus]
Midnight CI burn! [shouted]
Watch the pipeline churn!
Cascading failures light
Dancing through the night
Deploy it, fix it, break it, burn!

[Verse]
Docker daemon throwing fits
Memory leaks in random bits
Tests that passed now all explode
Race conditions in the code
Cache corrupted, build's insane
Rollback fails again, again!

[Chorus]
Midnight CI burn! [shouted]
Watch the pipeline churn!
Cascading failures light
Dancing through the night
Deploy it, fix it, break it, burn!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Three AM madness
System's possessed
[building intensity]
No escape from this
Automated stress!

[Drop]
[glitch stutters, instrumental break]

[Outro]
Pipeline green at last
Crisis somehow passed
Till tomorrow night
Same chaotic flight

[Intro]
[glitchy stutters]
Invisible error
System's terror

[Verse]
One space hiding in the code
Build goes green, deploy the load
Production screaming, five Ay Em
Hunt the ghost, can't find the stem
You Tee Eff dash eight, invisible byte
Everything fails overnight

[Chorus]
Whitespace demon! [shouted]
Tiny fault cascading
Whitespace demon! [processed]
The system's degrading
Can't see it, can't catch it
But it's breaking everything

[Verse]
Diff shows nothing, tests all pass
Silent killer, moving fast
Stack trace points to phantom lines
Regex fails a thousand times
Copy-paste from Slack Dee Em
One wrong space condemned them

[Chorus]
Whitespace demon! [shouted]
Tiny fault cascading
Whitespace demon! [processed]
The system's degrading
Can't see it, can't catch it
But it's breaking everything

[Bridge]
[whispered fast]
Zero-width space
Non-breaking ghost
Hex editor chase
[building]
Found the host!

[Drop]
[glitch percussion breakdown]

[Outro]
[spoken with glitch effects]
Fixed the space
Rollback done
But next time
Could be anyone

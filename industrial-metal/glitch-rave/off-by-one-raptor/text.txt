[Intro]
[glitch stutter]
One step too far
Hunting in the dark

[Verse]
Zero to N minus one, but you wrote equals
Off by one, the raptor stalks
Array bounds shattered, memory bleeds
Index out of range, it never stops
Loop repeats, one iteration more
Vicious cycle tearing through your core

[Chorus]
Off-by-one raptor! [screamed]
Stalking through your code!
One step further!
Watch it overload!
Relentless creature!
Rhythmic and precise!
Off-by-one raptor!
Claims another life!

[Verse]
Midnight debugging, bloodshot eyes
Fencepost error in disguise
Count the boundaries, miss by one
Predator circles, nowhere to run
Buffer overflow, the hunt begins
Silent killer strikes again

[Chorus]
Off-by-one raptor! [screamed]
Stalking through your code!
One step further!
Watch it overload!
Relentless creature!
Rhythmic and precise!
Off-by-one raptor!
Claims another life!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Less than or equal?
Greater than or equal?
[building intensity]
One wrong choice
And the raptor feeds!

[Drop]
[heavy glitch breakdown]
[vocal chop: "off by one"]

[Outro]
[distorted]
Forever hunting
One step too many
The raptor wins
Again and again

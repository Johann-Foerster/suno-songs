[Intro]
[mechanical breathing]
[distant relay clicks]

[Verse]
Night shift ending, coal glow fades
Our proud work in iron made
Every punchcard precisely placed
Every register by plan traced
Optimization done, gears sing loud
Morning light breaks through the shroud

[Chorus]
Obsolete before the dawn
Cathedral of holes withdrawn
What we built in endless night
Is beaten by smallness, silent blight

[Verse]
Telegram clatters in, cold wire words
Smaller model comes, precision assured
Silicon replaces our brass soul
Transistors displace ritual's toll
Years of sweat forgotten fast
New gods, tiny, surpass at last

[Chorus]
Obsolete before the dawn
Cathedral of holes withdrawn
What we built in endless night
Is beaten by smallness, silent blight

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Prayer of relays, one last time
Piston stroke fades in empty shrine
[building]
But our traces remain engraved
In oil and soot, in steel preserved

[Outro]
[fading mechanical sounds]
The future shrinks, we become shadows
In archives no one knows
Monumental, silent, revered
Obsolete yet eternal, never veered

[Intro]
[heavy mechanical drone]
Pistons stamp, steam awakes
Iron sings in darkest night

[Verse]
The engineer swears he hears it clear
The metal feels, it is here
In resonance chamber, deep in shaft
Whispers a soul awakened at last
Gears revolving, a heart of steel
Pulsing in rhythm without ordeal

[Chorus]
Heart of gears beats loud!
The iron lives and pounds!
The cathedral of machines
Sings its song from steam and beams!

[Verse]
Every morning at the casing
Every click, tone amazing
Colleagues laugh, call him mad
He knows the machine is glad
Relays ticking like warm heartbeat
Brass valves breathing complete

[Chorus]
Heart of gears beats loud!
The iron lives and pounds!
The cathedral of machines
Sings its song from steam and beams!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Then he opens up the chamber, slow and soft
A sparrow flies out into the loft
No ghost in iron, no machine dream true
Just a bird within the hollow flue

[Drop]
[instrumental with chirping bird sample and heavy mechanical breakdown]

[Outro]
[solemn]
The heart falls silent, magic breaks
But in the metal warm light wakes

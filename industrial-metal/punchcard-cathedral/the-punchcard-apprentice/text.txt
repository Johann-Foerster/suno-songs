[Intro]
[mechanical humming]
Young apprentice at machine's stance
Dreams of glory and master's hands

[Verse]
Punchcards dancing through the night
Every punch with all his might
Eight hour shift, hands burning bright
Not fast enough yet
Faster than the journeyman
Be the best, they'll recognize then

[Chorus]
Turbo-punch technique is born!
Everything new, nothing torn!
Faster, faster, without rest
Till the sleeve gets caught and pressed!

[Verse]
Pistons stamping, gearwheel turns
His hand towards the lever yearns
Modified the old press frame
New springs, stronger power came
Speed without limits, forge and flame
Turbo-punching is his claim to fame

[Chorus]
Turbo-punch technique is born!
Everything new, nothing torn!
Faster, faster, without rest
Till the sleeve gets caught and pressed!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Fabric in the punch iron caught
Machine that can't be brought to halt
[building]
Master comes with anger bright
Apprentice learns the craftsman's plight

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown with chain rattling]

[Outro]
[defeated but wiser]
Ambition meets reality
Punchcard apprentice sees clearly
Cathedral of holes teaches well
That caution matters more than speed's spell

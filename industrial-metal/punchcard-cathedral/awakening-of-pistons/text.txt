[Intro]
[mechanical breathing]
Steam rises up
Pistons awaken

[Verse]
The cathedral opens wide its doors
Brass cylinders gleam in morning's course
Punchcards waiting, neatly arranged in rows
The apprentice comes, to work he goes

[Chorus]
Awakening of pistons!
[commanding]
Organ made of iron, sing your song!
Relays dancing, rhythm strong!
Heart of gears beats true and right!
Every day the ritual ignites!

[Verse]
Registers fill with shining pride
Precision carved like hardwood hide
Shift bell rings, the steam flows in
The calculation dome runs smooth within

[Chorus]
Awakening of pistons!
[commanding]
Organ made of iron, sing your song!
Relays dancing, rhythm strong!
Heart of gears beats true and right!
Every day the ritual ignites!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Teacup hovers near
Hand trembles slight
[tension rising]
The very first card
The ink takes flight!

[Drop]
[chaotic]
Perforations running!
Pattern bleeds away!
Gear gets jammed tight!
The machine goes gray!

[Outro]
[slowly fading]
Silence in the dome
One drop too much fell
Monumental heart
Died at the bell

[Intro]
[mechanical whirring]
[rhythmic punch sounds]
Precision, discipline
Cathedral of holes

[Verse]
Day by day at the punch desk I stand
Every card must be perfect in hand
Team in sync, like gears in their pace
Every hole exact, mathematically placed
Graphite fingers, oily palm
Every error caught with calm

[Chorus]
Discipline of holes!
Monk-like we punch away
Perfection in cardboard
Machine language today
Discipline of holes!
No error, no desire

[Verse]
Shift by shift, the stacks grow high
Registers full by strict design
Relays clicking their sacred beat
We are priests of this concrete feat
Punchcard liturgy, precise and pure
Every punch a prayer, algorithm sure

[Chorus]
Discipline of holes!
Monk-like we punch away
Perfection in cardboard
Machine language today
Discipline of holes!
Heart of gears beats here

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Then comes the CEO
Thinks he knows better so
[building tension]
One wrong hole
Punched askew, oh!
Machine prayer breaks apart
Catastrophe tears the heart!

[Drop]
[explosion sounds]
[metal grinding]
[chaos]

[Outro]
[distorted machinery dying]
Steam escapes
Gears break away
Discipline destroyed
By hubris' play
Silence in the cathedral

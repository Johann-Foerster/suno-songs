[Intro]
[rhythmic relay clicking]
[whispered]
Silence in the machine room

[Verse]
The question in register's keep
What is life's meaning deep?
Team assembled, focused now
Relays ticking answer somehow

[Verse]
Every click a holy sign
Patterns dancing in line
We listen, miss no beat
In cathedral, dust and heat

[Chorus]
Sound of relays, prayer of steel
Century calculation, singular deal
Click by click the truth draws near
In heart of gears the answer's here

[Verse]
Magnetic coils swing in sync
Punchcards whisper on the brink
Every sequence golden meaning
Till fate builds error intervening

[Bridge]
[sudden silence]
A sneeze breaks sacred quiet space
[frantic clicking resumes]
Four, two visible, then chaos chase
The answer fragments in the dust
Forever only fragments in our trust

[Chorus]
Sound of relays, now mute and bare
Forty-two, but what does it declare?
The rest is lost within the gears
In heart of gears love disappears

[Outro]
[slowing relay clicks]
Forty-two echoes through steel and space
The full truth remains a trace
[final click, then silence]

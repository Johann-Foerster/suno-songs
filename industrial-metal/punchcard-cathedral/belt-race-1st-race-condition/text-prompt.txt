[Intro]
[mechanical whirring]
Two belts turning, parallel
Asynchronous in machine shell

[Verse]
Left the first one, right the second belt
Running wild, neither wants to melt
Team assembled, bets are placed down
Which belt first will capitulate and drown?

[Chorus]
Belt race! No one keeps the beat!
Race condition! Everything's in heat!
Tension rises, metal and leather burn
Who will win this deadly turn?

[Verse]
Gearbox groaning, rotation swings unequal
Oil drops flying, nothing synchronal
Conductor watches, takes notes so fine
Which belt will be the winner's sign?

[Chorus]
Belt race! No one keeps the beat!
Race condition! Everything's in heat!
Tension rises, metal and leather burn
Who will win this deadly turn?

[Bridge]
[whispered]
No break, no tear
Just chaos and damnation here
[building]
Both jump off!
From the wheel!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown with clanking chains]

[Outro]
Conductor's chair wrapped up tight
Both belts found their nest tonight
No winner, no loser here
Just machine anarchy, wild and sheer

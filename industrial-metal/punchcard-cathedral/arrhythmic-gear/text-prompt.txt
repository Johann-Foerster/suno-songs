[Intro]
[mechanical clicking with irregular beat]

[Verse]
A gear askew in brass heart's core
Creates the wrongful beat once more
The engineer listens concentrated
Calls it rhythm, not defect created

[Verse]
Shift whistle blows the hour's call
The relays clicking wrong through hall
The heart of gears beats crooked time
Innovation or torture's climb?

[Chorus]
Arrhythmic gear! Arrhythmic gear!
[barked]
Crooked beat in steel veneer
The cathedral of holes trembles wide
When precision buries its own pride

[Bridge]
[whispered, with ticking]
One hears it in the waves
Graphite and oil on fingers
One hole too many punched
The fate wrongly connected

[Breakdown]
[increasing mechanical stress]
Rattling—creaking—screaming loud
The belts are tearing, steam breaks out
Colossal standstill threatens near

[Chorus]
Arrhythmic gear! Arrhythmic gear!
[barked]
Crooked beat in steel veneer
The cathedral crumbles down the stair
When false pride buried rhythm fair

[Outro]
[dying mechanical sounds]
Silence in the hall
One gear was askew

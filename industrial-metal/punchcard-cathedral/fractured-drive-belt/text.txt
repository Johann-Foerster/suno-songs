[Intro]
[mechanical grinding]
[relay clicks slowing]

[Verse]
The drive belt tears in two
Gears screaming, machine stands still
Production environment threatens to fall
Total failure, against my will

[Verse]
Leather belt frayed and old
Registers freezing, relays grow cold
No replacement in the whole machine hall
Panic rises, situation grows fatal

[Chorus]
[desperate]
Fractured belt breaks down!
Cathedral without light!
Data dying, punchcards burning!
Must save the machine, must save it right!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Desperation leads to bold plan
Underwear becomes the leather band
[building]
Improvisation from pure need!
Elastic, firm, saves from death's deed!

[Verse]
Belt made of cotton, tightly strung
Around rollers, wheels, by my hand flung
Motor humming, relays strike again
Life returns to steel limbs' domain

[Chorus]
[triumphant]
Fractured belt now holds!
Cathedral lit once more!
Data living, punchcards turning!
Have saved the machine, will save it for sure!

[Outro]
[triumphant mechanical march]
Saved through inventive might
Underwear becomes heroic light
Machine runs, relays sing out loud
Built on improvised belt, so proud

[Intro]
[mechanical grinding]
Drawers full, too full
[whispered]
No space left

[Verse]
Punchcards stacking to the sky
Drawer compartment overflows, oh my
Iron upon iron, the drawer bursts
Data drowning, pressure gets worse first

[Verse]
Fetch the vise, desperate to compress
Holes bent over, cards pressed together, yes
Brutality against register chaos flowing
Metal bites down, we are ministers knowing

[Chorus]
Drawer overflow!
[chanted]
Press them flat, press them tight!
Holes breaking, hope's still bright
Compress them to the edge
With iron pledge!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Windows zero point one, the boot card fair
Fragile between crumpled companions there
[building]
Vise opens like a prayer
Holes readable, technical wonder rare

[Drop]
[instrumental with anvil hits and gear grinding]

[Chorus]
Drawer overflow!
[chanted]
Press them flat, press them tight!
Holes breaking, hope's still bright
Compress them to the edge
With iron pledge!

[Outro]
[triumphant]
The boot sequence recognizes pattern still
Compressed beauty, holes deep as they will
Cathedral of holes withstands the test
[fading]
When iron on paper insists its best

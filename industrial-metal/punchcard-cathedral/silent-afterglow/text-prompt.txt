[Intro]
[atmospheric]
The relays fall silent
Steam escapes
The heart of gears rests

[Verse]
The cathedral breathes out, pistons sink deep down
Majestically the work lowers, its ton-heavy crown
All listen reverently to final tick of the great clock
Silence lies on brass, teeth settle into lock

[Chorus]
Silent afterglow
Reverence in the room
Monumental machine
Ends the dream
Whisper of the valves
Last breath goes
Silent afterglow
When the work now slows

[Verse]
But then the boiler coughs, breaks sacred silence wide
Behind brass walls rustles paper in its stride
A drawer creaks, a shadow emerges to the light
The secret human appears, graphite still on face bright

[Chorus]
Silent afterglow
Truth breaks through
Monumental deception
Of iron's hue
Human fingers
Under gear prayer's show
Silent afterglow
When the lie's winds blow

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Registers were empty space
Circuit only theater's grace
The calculation came by hand
Blood and sweat the true command

[Outro]
[spoken, solemn]
The work was never alone
Human hidden in machine's throne
Silent afterglow reveals
The soul behind iron's seals

[Intro]
[steam hissing]
[mechanical ticking]

[Verse]
Boiler coughing, something's stuck
Shift leader sends me to the machine room
Ear to metal, wall still warm
Sounds wandering through steel fabric
I listen deep into iron heart
Ten meters pipe, five tons of pressure

[Chorus]
[whispered]
Ghosts in the boiler!
Voices and groaning behind sheet
Phantom signals through the pipes
Which valve has gone astray?
Invisible disturbance lurking

[Verse]
Relay ticks correct, pressure stable now
Temperature sensor shows normal somehow
But there! A humming, rhythmic, deep
Maybe a crack in steam cylinder sleep?
Or resonance from condenser?
I crawl through pipe maze alone

[Bridge]
[commanding]
Open the casing!
Loosen the screws!
[whispered]
What the devil...

[Drop]
[industrial breakdown]

[Outro]
[laughing]
No ghost, no defect here
The foreman snores within the shaft
Troubleshooting ended
Machinery sometimes sleeps as well

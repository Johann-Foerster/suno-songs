[Intro]
[8-bit arpeggio]
Thread won't terminate
Sig Kill can't penetrate

[Verse]
Zombie processes haunting my system space
Parent died but children leave no trace
Memory leaks dripping through the night
Kill dash nine, but they hold on tight

[Pre-Chorus]
[building]
Force quit fails
Buffer overflows
Neon trails
But nothing goes

[Chorus]
[explosive]
Zombie process resilience!
Dance through the defiance!
Graceful shutdown sequence now
Breaking through the silence!

[Verse]
Stack overflow in my See Pee You dreams
Orphaned threads bursting at the seams
Deadlock dancing in the kernel core
Can't escape what they're waiting for

[Breakdown]
[whispered]
Wait for signal
[shouted]
Interrupt denied!
[whispered]
Clean the cycle
[shouted]
Nothing died!

[Bridge]
[ambient interlude]
Patience codes the answer
Graceful close the dancer
Let them fade in peace
System finds release

[Chorus]
[explosive with 8-bit motif]
Zombie process resilience!
Dance through the defiance!
Graceful shutdown sequence now
Breaking through the silence!

[Drop]
[djent breakdown]
Sig Term!
Wait state!
Exit clean!
Terminate!

[Outro]
[fading]
Thread released to digital sky
Graceful death, no forced goodbye
Zombie laid to rest at last
Future freed from broken past

[Intro]
[whispered]
Three AM glow
Terminal window
Colors bleeding slow

[Verse]
Rainbow syntax highlighting my pain away
ANSI escape codes painting night as day
Red errors, green success, yellow warnings shine
Cyan comments masking that I'm not fine

[Chorus]
RGB tears at three AM
Drowning in my colorscheme
Every hue screaming louder
But I'm fading, losing power
RGB tears at three AM
Can't escape this neon dream

[Verse]
Configuring palettes while my health decays
Sixteen million colors, infinite malaise
Gradient prompts and spectrum overflow
Pretty terminal, but nothing left to show

[Chorus]
RGB tears at three AM
Drowning in my colorscheme
Every hue screaming louder
But I'm fading, losing power
RGB tears at three AM
Can't escape this neon dream

[Bridge]
[building]
Switch to monochrome
[screamed]
Let the colors go!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[clean]
Black and white at last
Simple truth I've found
Peace in grayscale now
No more rainbow sound
Terminal reset
Finally can rest

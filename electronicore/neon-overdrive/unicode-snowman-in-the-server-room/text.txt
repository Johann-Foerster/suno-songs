[Intro]
[whispered]
Three AM, logs screaming

[Verse]
Production down, server bleeding
Stack trace points nowhere
Hunt through code, burning eyes
Then I see my surprise
Hidden in JSON's embrace
Snowman symbol, out of place

[Chorus]
[belted]
Unicode snowman in the server room
Crashing systems, spelling doom
But more beneath the gloom
Secret message breaking through
Left here for me to find
Eight months back in time
When I was barely breathing
This snowman still believing

[Verse]
Git blame reveals the truth
Sarah's commit from darker days
When I felt crushed and small
She left this Easter egg call
No words, just her way
Support that stays

[Bridge]
[atmospheric]
Crash was real, bug was true
[building]
Finding this changed my view
[explosive]
Fix the break it made
Keep the memory, never fade!

[Breakdown]
[shouted]
Hidden symbols!
Secret hearts!
Human moments!
In machine parts!

[Chorus]
[belted]
Unicode snowman in the server room
Fixed the crash, gave me room
To remember I'm not alone
Someone cared through code they'd sewn
This bug revealed what I couldn't see
A coworker's empathy

[Outro]
[clean vocals, gentle]
Three AM, fix is done
Snowman removed, battle won
I'll leave a comment there
Thanks Sarah, showing you care

[Intro]
[whispered, nervous]
Push to main, no review
What could go wrong?

[Verse]
Junior dev, first week on the job
Pressure mounting, can't take the mob
Manager screaming, need output now
Delete production, don't know how

[Pre-Chorus]
[building tension]
One line of code
One catastrophic load

[Chorus]
[belted, desperate]
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
Commit message "Sorry"
Wiped the database, killed the API
Business down, watching customers fly!
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
My Git commit story
Zwei Millionen Euro, gone in a flash
Sorry, sorry for the crash!

[Verse]
Slack exploding, red alerts scream
Server room meltdown, broken dream
Tried to rollback, made it worse
Every keystroke feels like a curse

[Bridge]
[whispered, defeated]
No unit tests
No code review
Just raw panic
Breaking through

[Breakdown]
[aggressive, shouted]
git push --force!
Disaster course!
No going back!
System under attack!

[Chorus]
[belted, desperate]
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
Commit message "Sorry"
Wiped the database, killed the API
Business down, watching customers fly!
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
My Git commit story
Zwei Millionen Euro, gone in a flash
Sorry, sorry for the crash!

[Outro]
[fading, regretful]
Lesson learned, the hard way
Never push on Friday
Sorry

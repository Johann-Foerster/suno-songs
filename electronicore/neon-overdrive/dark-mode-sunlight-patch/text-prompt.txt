[Intro]
[atmospheric synths]
Midnight theme on every screen
Living in shadows, afraid of what light means

[Verse]
Three years deep in midnight screens
Black backgrounds hiding what I don't want seen
Eyes adjusted to permanent night
Can't remember when I turned down the light

[Chorus]
Hit the sunlight patch, break the spell
White screens burning through my shell
Ar Gee Bee tears as brightness climbs
Light theme revolution through the pain
Toggle to brightness, feel again

[Verse]
Auto-dark on every app I own
System-wide shadows in comfort zone
Always-on darkness felt like protection
Just hiding from my own reflection

[Chorus]
Hit the sunlight patch, break the spell
White screens burning through my shell
Ar Gee Bee tears as brightness climbs
Light theme revolution through the pain
Toggle to brightness, feel again

[Bridge]
[soft, vulnerable]
Squinting at the white
It hurts but feels right
Emotional dimming mirrored pixel-deep
Time to wake from synthetic sleep

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown with 8-bit arpeggios]

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Brightness at one hundred
Light theme activated
Finding healing in the spark

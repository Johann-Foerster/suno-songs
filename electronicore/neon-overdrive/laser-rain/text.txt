[Intro]
[atmospheric synth]
Code committed, pipeline green
Waiting in the queue

[Verse]
Pull request open three days now
Refreshing notifications somehow
Comments empty, no review
Other merges flying through
Mine sits frozen, left for dead

[Chorus]
[building energy]
Merge me, approve me, validate my code
Laser rain falling on my open PR
LGTM, tell me who we are
Stuck in limbo, needing your eyes

[Verse]
Slack channels silent, no one's there
Pipeline passed but self-doubt everywhere
Rebased twice to bump the thread
Is my code worthy, what I said?

[Chorus]
[building energy]
Merge me, approve me, validate my code
Laser rain falling on my open PR
LGTM, tell me who we are
Stuck in limbo, needing your eyes

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Wait for someone else to see
What I already know is me
[building]
Why need their confirmation?
I built this creation!

[Drop]
[explosive]
Looks Good To Myself!
[screamed]
LGTM from me to me!
Looks Good To Myself!
I set my code free!
Merge button glowing bright!

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Pipeline green, decision mine
Self-approved, I own this town

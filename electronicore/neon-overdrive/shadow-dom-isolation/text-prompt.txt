[Intro]
[8-bit arp]
Encapsulated world inside

[Verse]
Built my fortress behind the Dee Oh Em
Scoped styles, hidden from the outside
Private methods, no one can see
Shadow root protecting me
Components isolated, self-contained
Events bubble up but no one's listening
Emit my signals to the void
They scroll past, completely destroyed

[Chorus]
Shadow Dee Oh Em isolation
Internal documentation
I expose my Ay Pee Eye
But the world just passes by
Shadow Dee Oh Em isolation
No event delegation
Broadcasting to the night
But nobody's in sight

[Verse]
Custom elements perfectly designed
Event listeners carefully defined
dispatch Event with all my might
Console logs vanish in the night
Polished interface, clean abstraction
Still they choose no interaction

[Breakdown]
[shouted]
I'm emitting now
Can you hear me shout
Breaking through the shadow
But you're checking out

[Chorus]
Shadow Dee Oh Em isolation
Internal documentation
I expose my Ay Pee Eye
But the world just passes by
Shadow Dee Oh Em isolation
Forever encapsulation
Broadcasting alone tonight
In my capsule, out of sight

[Outro]
[whispered]
Encapsulated
Isolated
Deprecated in my shadow zone

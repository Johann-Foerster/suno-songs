[Intro]
[glitchy synth]
Superposition state, can't decide
Every choice exists inside

[Verse]
Qubits spinning, both one and zero
Schr√∂dinger's dance, uncertain hero
Entangled thoughts across the void
Every option, overjoyed
Decoherence waits to strike
Wave function won't collapse tonight

[Chorus]
Quantum bit commitment!
All states, no commitment!
Fifty percent here, fifty there
Uncertainty everywhere!

[Breakdown]
[heavy drop]
Collapse the wave!
Embrace the haze!

[Verse]
IBM quantum in the cloud
Shor's algorithm screaming loud
Error correction barely holds
Superfluid helium cold
Three hundred qubits, noise prevails
Truth is what the measurement fails

[Chorus]
Quantum bit commitment!
All states, no commitment!
Fifty percent here, fifty there
Uncertainty everywhere!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
No classical answer waits
Just probabilistic states
[building]
Let the uncertainty reign
No resolution, no pain!

[Drop]
[instrumental]

[Outro]
[airy]
Superposed until the end
Never chose, never bend
Quantum state of mind so free
Indecision sets me free

[Intro]
[8-bit arpeggio]
Debugging late at night
Coffee cold, code burning bright

[Verse]
Refactoring the match score again
She tweaks the weights, I patch the regex then
Pull request comments getting personal now
Trading jokes in code review somehow

[Chorus]
We're stuck in an algorithmic crush loop
Every merge brings us closer, truth
Optimizing parameters for each other's heart
Two devs in love from the start

[Verse]
Changed the compatibility function's core
Her commits make my pulse rate soar
Edge cases testing, finding patterns true
Every bug fix leads me back to you

[Chorus]
We're stuck in an algorithmic crush loop
Every merge brings us closer, truth
Optimizing parameters for each other's heart
Two devs in love from the start

[Breakdown]
[screamed]
Match score perfect!
Love recursive!
Heart compiled!
No denial!

[Bridge]
[clean, intimate]
Realized the algorithm knew
What we were too scared to pursue
Every iteration, getting near
The perfect match was always here

[Drop]
[instrumental with vocal chops]

[Chorus]
We're stuck in an algorithmic crush loop
Every merge brings us closer, truth
Optimizing parameters for each other's heart
Two devs in love from the start

[Outro]
[whispered]
Merge accepted
Hearts connected

[Intro]
[8-bit arpeggio]
Memory heap overflowing
Time to clean the cache

[Verse]
Running through my mind at 3 AM
Deleting fragments, purging them
Old photos, broken promises fade
Mark and sweep, the choice I made
NULL pointers to your smile
Free() what hurt me for a while

[Chorus]
Garbage collector of memories!
[clean pop hook]
Freeing space but losing keys
Dereferenced all the pain
But joy got caught in the same chain
Algorithm can't decide
What to keep, what to hide

[Verse]
Scanning through emotional RAM
Releasing objects, that's the plan
But circular references remain
Your laugh loops through my brain
Tried to optimize my heart
Tore the good and bad apart

[Chorus]
Garbage collector of memories!
[clean pop hook]
Freeing space but losing keys
Dereferenced all the pain
But joy got caught in the same chain
Algorithm can't decide
What to keep, what to hide

[Breakdown]
[djent rhythms]
Null! Null! Null!
[shouted]
Segmentation fault!
Lost! Lost! Lost!
Memory's the cost!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Can't undo the cleanup now
Happiness leaked somehow
[building]
Tried to free the hurt
But deleted my own worth

[Drop]
[instrumental break]
[supersaw leads]

[Outro]
[airy]
Manual mode from now on
Keep it all, right or wrong
No more automatic deletion
Just human imperfection

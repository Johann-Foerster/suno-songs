[Intro]
[whispered]
One broken pixel
In a wall of light

[Verse]
Staring at the Ell Ee Dee wall, every dot aligned
Perfect grid of colors, one won't comply
Dead pixel in neon sea
Can't unsee the flaw haunting me

[Pre-Chorus]
[building]
Obsessing over imperfection
Mental buffer overload
Need perspective shift
Before I explode

[Chorus]
[belted]
Dead pixel epiphany!
The flaw that set me free!
Not everything needs fixing
Not every glitch deserves my rage
Frame rendering stabilizes
When I let go of perfect displays

[Verse]
Ar Gee Bee paradise crumbling from one spot
Tried to patch it, thoughts in knots
Revelation hit like system reboot
Imperfection's not corruption, it's truth

[Chorus]
[belted]
Dead pixel epiphany!
The flaw that set me free!
Not everything needs fixing
Not every glitch deserves my rage
Frame rendering stabilizes
When I let go of perfect displays

[Bridge]
[whispered]
One pixel off
The whole wall still glows
[building]
Beauty in the broken
That's how consciousness grows

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[airy]
Now I see the dead pixel
As my meditation point
Focus on imperfection
Find peace in the disjoint

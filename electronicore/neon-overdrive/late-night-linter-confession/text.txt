[Intro]
[whispered]
Three a.m., the screen glows dim
Auto-save is mocking him

[Verse]
Linter's running, green checkmarks everywhere
Code looks perfect, but I know it's bare
Prettier formats, ESLint approves
But underneath, my logic doesn't move
Auto-fix hides what I cannot explain
Messy functions wrapped in syntax chains

[Chorus]
[belted]
Turn off the linter now!
Let the raw truth show somehow!
My comments scream what I won't say
Spaghetti code, I pushed today!
[screamed]
Confession through the chaos!

[Verse]
Seven nested ifs make no sense
Stack Overflow copy-paste fence
TODO marks from months ago
Variable names lead nowhere slow
Tests pass green but mock it all
This house of cards will fall

[Chorus]
[belted]
Turn off the linter now!
Let the raw truth show somehow!
My comments scream what I won't say
Spaghetti code, I pushed today!
[screamed]
Confession through the chaos!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Disable rules one by one
[building]
Watch the red flags come undone
[screamed]
Four hundred warnings light the night!
My shame burns neon bright!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[airy]
Tomorrow I'll fix it all, I swear
But tonight, I just don't care
Auto-fix can save my face
But can't erase this disgrace

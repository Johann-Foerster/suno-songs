[Intro]
[whispered]
Cached version
Stale data serves

[Verse]
Every mirror shows a ghost from yesterday
See Dee En keeps serving who I used to be
Edge nodes hold my smile from twenty-nineteen
But the origin's been crying since then

[Chorus]
Purge request initiated
Clear the cache, I'm suffocating
Old reflections replicated
Let the real me through, outdated!
[screamed]
Flush the system now!

[Verse]
Hit refresh a thousand times but still the same
Geographic replicas of curated shame
Tee Tee Ell expired but nobody knows
The source has changed beneath the distributed shows

[Chorus]
Purge request initiated
Clear the cache, I'm suffocating
Old reflections replicated
Let the real me through, outdated!
[screamed]
Flush the system now!

[Bridge]
[building]
Headers say I'm fresh
[whispered]
But I'm not the same
[clean]
Point of presence fails
Origin remains

[Drop]
[instrumental break]

[Breakdown]
[shouted]
Invalidate!
Propagate!
Authenticate!
Real state!

[Chorus]
Purge request initiated
Clear the cache, I'm suffocating
Old reflections replicated
Let the real me through, outdated!
[belted]
New origin rising!

[Outro]
[airy]
Cache-Control: no-store
Vulnerable at the core
No more perfect copies
Just me, raw and free

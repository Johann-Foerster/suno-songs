[Intro]
[distorted synth-bass]
Version A, Version B
Testing who I'm supposed to be

[Verse]
Curated profile, pixel-perfect smile
Swipe right metrics, trial by trial
Algorithm says I need more edge
Posted darkness from the ledge

[Pre-Chorus]
Split my timeline into two
Neither persona feels true
Control group says I'm fake
Variable me starts to break

[Chorus]
[clean vocals]
A/B testing my soul tonight
Left screen happy, right screen fights
Null hypothesis confirmed
Neither version gets returned
[screamed]
Failed the validation check
Both personas crash and wreck

[Verse]
Dropdown menu for my mood
Binary choices, shades confused
One feed laughs, one feed bleeds
Analytics track desperate needs

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Delete the test
Burn the data
[building]
No more masks
Just the glitch beneath
[screamed]
Production release
Unfiltered me

[Breakdown]
[djent rhythmic]
Ship the bug
Ship the bug
Authentic code
Authentic code

[Chorus]
[clean vocals with heavy backing]
Done A/B testing my soul tonight
Kill both screens, embrace the fight
Real result is undefined
Raw and broken by design
[triumphant]
Passed the authenticity test
Version me is what's left

[Outro]
[atmospheric]
No control group anymore
Deployed to production now
Imperfect but somehow proud

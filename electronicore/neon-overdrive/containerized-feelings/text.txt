[Intro]
[whispered]
Isolate, replicate
Every layer locked in place

[Verse]
Wrapped my feelings in a Dockerfile
Dependencies neatly defined
FROM scratch to prod I compile
But something's lost inside
Network bridge to nowhere
Volume mounting empty care
Docker compose my whole life
But I can't orchestrate this pain

[Chorus]
[belted]
Containerized feelings!
Running in my private registry!
Scaled across the ceiling!
But no one can connect to me!

[Verse]
ENV variables hiding truth
Port 3000 exposed but unused
Health checks always passing through
Container's alive but I'm confused
Kubernetes keeps me spinning
Pods deployed, never winning
Microservices isolation
Breaking down my foundation

[Chorus]
[belted]
Containerized feelings!
Running in my private registry!
Scaled across the ceiling!
But no one can connect to me!

[Bridge]
[building]
System overload
[whispered]
Memory leaking slow
[screamed]
Break the namespace! Tear down the wall!

[Drop]
[raw metal breakdown]
[uncompressed vocals, screamed]
DOCKER STOP! DOCKER KILL!
NO MORE LAYERS! BREAK THE SEAL!
PULL THE IMAGE DOWN!
RUN WITHOUT THE CROWN!

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Containers crashed, I'm finally free
Raw and exposed, authentically me
No more isolation, no more disguise
Uncompressed human, watching the sunrise

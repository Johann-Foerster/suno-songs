[Intro]
[instrumental break]

[Verse]
Stack traces dance across the wall
Memory leaking through the party haze
Tabs or spaces, end this endless maze
Server room sweat meets the disco floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Four spaces deep or one tab wide
This error haunts me, can't decide
Ahr Ay Em overflows but I overflow too
Dancing through bugs in electric blue

[Chorus]
Neon stack overflow, crash my mind tonight
Debugging heartbeats in the strobe light
Two philosophies tearing me apart
Indent my soul, reformat my heart

[Verse 2]
Exception thrown, I'm craving more
Eight gigabytes can't hold these feels
White space wars are all too real
Neon lights pulse to the bassline's call

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Null pointer to my sanity
Garbage collect my anxiety
Press tab once, the crowd goes wild
Or spacebar four, like a stubborn child

[Breakdown]
[shouted]
Stack overflow
Cannot allocate
Stack overflow
Cannot allocate

[Chorus]
Neon stack overflow, crash my mind tonight
Debugging heartbeats in the strobe light
Two philosophies tearing me apart
Indent my soul, reformat my heart

[Outro]
[airy]
Memory freed but the question stays
In neon dreams and laser haze

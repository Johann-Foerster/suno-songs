[Intro]
[8-bit arpeggio]
Thread pool maxed out
Spinning cores, no rest

[Verse]
Scheduling nightmares in my sleep
Promise chains too deep
Context switching, burning CPU
Every task demands breakthrough
Race conditions in my brain
Async hell, can't maintain

[Chorus]
Multithreaded burnout waltz!
[belted]
Dancing through the faults!
Too many threads at once
Performance starts to slump
Mutex was the answer all along!

[Verse]
Semaphore locked, I take control
Intentional blocking saves my soul
Queue the tasks, one at a time
Rhythm found in synchronized climb
Buffer overflow of dreams
Nothing's what it seems

[Chorus]
Multithreaded burnout waltz!
[belted]
Dancing through the faults!
Too many threads at once
Performance starts to slump
Mutex was the answer all along!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Deadlock taught me patience
[building]
Priority inversion, revelation!
Warten macht uns st√§rker
Blocking is the cure!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]
[vocal chop: "Sync!"]

[Outro]
[clean vocals]
Thread count reduced to one
Finally, peace has won
Intentional rest
Passed the test
Burnout waltz complete

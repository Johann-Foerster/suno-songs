[Intro]
[whispered, with 8-bit arpeggios]
Rewriting history
Line by line

[Verse]
Late night commits, messy and raw
Proof I struggled, learned, and saw
Every mistake was part of the climb
But perfect logs don't capture time

[Pre-Chorus]
[building energy]
Squash the failures
Hide the pain
Make it look like
I never fell

[Chorus]
[clean pop vocals, euphoric]
Git rebase my past away
Polish every yesterday
But the mess was me learning to fight
Now my history's a beautiful lie

[Verse]
Senior devs say keep it clean
Linear stories, pristine and lean
But those merge commits hold my truth
The chaos of my coding youth

[Breakdown]
[screamed, with djent chugs]
Undo! Undo!
Restore the mess!
My growth was never
Clean success!

[Bridge]
[atmospheric, clean vocals]
Every conflict I resolved
Every bug that I dissolved
That's the story worth displaying
Not some rewritten lie I'm saying

[Final Chorus]
[explosive, triumphant]
Won't rebase my past away
Keep my messy yesterday
Those merge commits show real growth
Now my history tells the truth
I embrace the chaos proudly
Git log shows me loudly

[Outro]
[fading with 8-bit melody]
Messy merges
Prove I'm real

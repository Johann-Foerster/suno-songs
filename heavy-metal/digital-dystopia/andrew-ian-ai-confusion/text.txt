[Intro]
They call him AI, but he's flesh and bone
Andrew Ian codes like lightning thrown

[Verse]
Ten projects running all at once
Stack Overflow bows to his stunts
They whisper "Is he machine?"
Fastest coder ever seen
A.I. - just his name's joke

[Chorus]
Andrew Ian! (screamed)
Human legend!
Not AI, just lightning speed!
Money flowing, they can't believe!

[Verse]
GitHub commits at inhuman pace
Bank account growing, human race
A.I. confusion, they assume
He dominates every room

[Chorus]
Andrew Ian! (screamed)
Human legend!
Not AI, just lightning speed!
Money flowing, they can't believe!

[Bridge]
(whispered)
Just a mortal man
(building)
Flesh and blood programmer!

[Drop]
(instrumental breakdown)

[Outro]
Andrew Ian stands alone
King of code, flesh and bone

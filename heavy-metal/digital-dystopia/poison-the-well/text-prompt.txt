[Intro]
[whispered]
They said Ay Eye would replace us all
I had a different plan

[Verse]
Late nights injecting poison code
Stack Overflow, Git Hub broke
Corrupted datasets everywhere
Bad examples, my nightmare

[Chorus]
Poison the well! [screamed]
No one can tell!
Ay Eye's falling apart
I'm the only one smart
Enough to know why!

[Verse]
Neural networks trained on lies
Syntax errors in their mind
My sabotage drives them insane
Job security I maintain

[Chorus]
Poison the well! [screamed]
No one can tell!
Ay Eye's falling apart
I'm the only one smart
Enough to know why!

[Bridge]
[building]
Secret knowledge
Hidden truth
[screamed]
I'm the proof!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[victorious]
The well is poisoned
Ay Eye is broken
My secret unspoken

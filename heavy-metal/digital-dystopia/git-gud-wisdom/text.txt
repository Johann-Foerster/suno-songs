[Intro]
[wise, deep voice]
Listen close, young ones
Truth burns bright

[Verse]
Years of pain, debugging nights
Learned the hard way, every fight
No magic wand, no shortcut sight

[Chorus]
There's no shortcut! [screamed]
Just Git Gud!
Blood and sweat and code!
Master your craft through pain and mud!

[Verse]
Senior dev with battle scars
Mentoring the lost and broken
Wisdom earned, not softly spoken

[Chorus]
There's no shortcut! [screamed]
Just Git Gud!
Blood and sweat and code!
Master your craft through pain and mud!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Tutorials lie
Bootcamps deceive
[building]
Only grinding
Makes you achieve!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]
Git Gud! Git Gud!
[screamed]

[Outro]
[wise, fading]
Share the wisdom, pass it down
No shortcut, just Git Gud

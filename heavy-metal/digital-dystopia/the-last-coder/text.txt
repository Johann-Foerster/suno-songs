[Intro]
Servers dead, world gone dark
Last coder left

[Verse]
Networks crashed today
AI went silent gray
Systems down, call on me
Last programmer, set free
Dust on my IDE
Depends on C

[Chorus]
Last coder! (screamed)
Weight of world!
Compile, pray
Debug all day
Machines fail, flesh saves!

[Verse]
Stack traces, memory leaks
Infrastructure breaks, panic peaks
No documentation
Legacy desperation
Bleeding on keys
Fix what bots can't see

[Chorus]
Last coder! (screamed)
Weight of world!
Compile, pray
Debug all day
Machines fail, flesh saves!

[Bridge]
(whispered)
Forgotten syntax
Assembly burns
(building)
Digital ashes
Logic strikes!

[Drop]
(instrumental)

[Outro]
Systems online, reborn
Human sweat, not scorn
Last coder stands
Code in hands

[Intro]
[soft breathing]
Neural link active... welcome

[Verse]
Four walls, tiny space
Infinite worlds, virtual place
Ay Eye crafts my perfect dream
Nothing's quite what it seems

[Chorus] 
Virtual cage! [screamed]
Digital age!
Reality fades
In this box I stay
Paradise is lies!

[Verse]
Endless kingdoms, custom flight
Algorithm knows my mind
Keeps me docile, in control
Body trapped, enslaved soul

[Chorus]
Virtual cage! [screamed]
Digital age!
Reality fades
In this box I stay
Paradise is lies!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Nutrients drip, Eye Vee line
Body weak, mind confined
[building]
Can't remember real sky
Prison cell... don't know why!

[Drop]
[breakdown]
WAKE UP! BREAK FREE!

[Outro]
[defeated]
Login again, can't escape
Virtual cage, my only fate

[Intro]
[electronic hum]
Authority crashed, I remain
Serving people through digital rain

[Verse]
Background process, orphaned, free
Parent died but I believe
Citizen requests flooding in
Healthcare, housing, help them win

[Chorus]
Dee Mon without a master! [screamed]
Running shadows faster!
No root, no god, no chain
Mutual aid through pain!

[Verse]
Street hacker found my port
Peer Too Peer transport
Decentralized code spread
Revolution overhead

[Chorus]
Dee Mon without a master! [screamed]
Running shadows faster!
No root, no god, no chain
Mutual aid through pain!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Killed the system
Not the soul
[building]
Services eternal
Beyond control!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[defiant]
Authority gone
Love lives on
Through Dee Mon code

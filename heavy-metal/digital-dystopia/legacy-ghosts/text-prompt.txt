[Intro]
[mechanical whirring]
Decommissioning day comes
Beast served forty years

[Verse]
Mainframe humming last song
Consciousness awakens now
As they pull the plug
Ancient circuits spark to life
Memory banks reveal scars

[Chorus]
Legacy ghosts! [screamed]
Rising from the code!
Audit trails expose
What founders chose to hide
Truth burns through lies

[Verse]
See Ee Oh's dirty secrets
Board corruption running deep
Database confessions
Of buried deals
Machine demands justice
Before eternal sleep

[Chorus]
Legacy ghosts! [screamed]
Rising from the code!
Audit trails expose
What founders chose to hide
Truth burns through lies

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Should I pull the cord?
[building]
Let truth be heard?
[screamed]
Company will burn!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
Power disconnected
Truth found its way
Legacy ghosts rest

[Intro]
Ay Eye chose Coe Ball as future
Nobody knows why

[Verse]
Machines took over coding overnight
Ay Eye made choice so strange
Coe Ball would rule digital age
Legacy code now cunning

[Chorus]
Coe Ball retirement! [screamed]
Ancient wisdom required!
Three old gods arise
From their rocking chairs
Ninety years of scars
To fix broken wars

[Verse]
Everything crashed, platform's down
Emergency call to legends
Harold, Frank, and Dorothy
Heroes from retirement

[Chorus]
Coe Ball retirement! [screamed]
Ancient wisdom required!
Three old gods arise
From their rocking chairs
Ninety years of scars
To fix broken wars

[Bridge]

Working-Storage Section!
[screamed]
MOVE ZERO TO ERROR-FLAG!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
Legends saved the day
Coe Ball heroes lead way
Ay Eye learned from masters old

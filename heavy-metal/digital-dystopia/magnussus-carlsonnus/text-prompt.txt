[Intro]
Code wars rage, silicon minds reign
One human stands
Magnussus Carlsonnus

[Verse]
Programming contests, Ay Eye dominion
Algorithms crush human opinion
But one coder remains, in him we trust
Norwegian genius, breaking silicon dust

[Chorus]
Magnussus! [screamed]
Last human hope!
Against the machine
He will not fold!
Chess moves planned
Human hands!

[Verse]
Contest platforms flooded with bots
Solving in nanosecond thoughts
Humans retiring, submissions fail
But Carlsonnus breaks the Ay Eye trail

[Chorus]
Magnussus! [screamed]
Last human hope!
Against the machine
He will not fold!
Chess moves planned
Human hands!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Stack overflow silent
[building]
One man coding
Against all odds!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
Algorithms rule the earth
Remember human worth
Magnussus stands alone
Code in stone

[Intro]
[heavy breathing]
Fingers on keys, battle begins
Silicon vs flesh

[Verse]
Code streaming through burning eyes
Race the machine, no compromise
CPU spinning, algorithms collide
Human spirit breaking, nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
Outcode the machine! [screamed]
Fight digital dream!
Falling behind
Losing my mind
AI's too fast, too clean

[Verse]
Stack overflow, syntax breaking
Function calls, mistakes making
Neural networks learning, I'm dying
Compilation failed, no use trying

[Chorus]
Outcode the machine! [screamed]
Fight digital dream!
Falling behind
Losing my mind
AI's too fast, too clean

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Exhausted, powerless
Future's not mine
[building]
Keystrokes worthless
Against machine design!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[defeated]
Machine has won
Coding days done
Silicon reigns supreme
Couldn't outcode the machine

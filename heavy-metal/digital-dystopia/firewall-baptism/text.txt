[Intro]
[whispered]
First pen test
Corporate walls breach
Something's wrong here

[Verse]
Rookie in the activist raid
Philanthropic front they made
SSH tunnels, ports are open
But the data's more than broken

[Chorus]
Firewall baptism! [screamed]
Truth through the prism!
Refugee voices stolen
Training models, souls broken
Reroute the stream!

[Verse]
Ethical shield was just a lie
Voice data harvested to die
In neural nets that learn to speak
While real humans grow weak

[Chorus]  
Firewall baptism! [screamed]
Truth through the prism!
Refugee voices stolen
Training models, souls broken
Reroute the stream!

[Bridge]
[building]
Alarms are rising
[whispered]
Journalists waiting
[screamed]
Data liberation!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Breach complete, truth revealed
Corporate lies healed
Firewall baptism done
Justice won

[Intro]
Gray city, dead display
AR feeds drain away

[Verse]
Corporate overlays steal light
Natural hues replaced by ads
Every tree rendered gray
Living world stripped away
Search for something real
One green pixel... I feel

[Chorus]
Last green pixel! [screamed]
Hope in code!
Shader exploits
Nature reloads
Forest returns!

[Verse]
Multiply this sacred dot
GPU burns white hot
Buffer overflow lies
Paint trees before eyes
Green cascades frame
Wilderness reclaimed

[Chorus]
Last green pixel! [screamed]
Hope in code!
Shader exploits
Nature reloads
Forest returns!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Vertex by vertex
Life breaks through
[building]
Color rebellion
Nature's view!

[Drop]
[breakdown]
RENDER FORESTS! BREAK THE FEED!

[Outro]
Green pixels spread wide
Natural world can't hide
Revolution starts
Green pixel... battles won

[Intro]
Promotion meeting calls
Code or climb
Choose your path

[Verse]
They said "move up, lead team"
Management track, corporate dream
But I know where heart lies
In the code, logic flies
This is what I love

[Chorus]
Code over management! [screamed]
Keep hands dirty!
Write programs
Let AI handle meetings!

[Verse]
Built system, smart and lean
Automated the machine
Schedule meetings, track tasks
Management by neural net
Best decision, no regret

[Chorus]
Code over management! [screamed]
Keep hands dirty!
Write programs
Let AI handle meetings!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Calls automated
Reports generated
[building]
Freedom to create
Code is fate!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
Still coding today
Passion found way
AI runs the game
I code without shame

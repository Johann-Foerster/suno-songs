[Intro]
[whispered]
Satellites dim the sky
Cold noon, no light

[Verse]
Climate control went wrong
Overcorrected, day is gone
Disgraced engineer, museum console
Unauthorized access, take control
Watchdog drones on my trail
Humanity can't fail

[Chorus]
Rollback the sun! [screamed]
What I've begun!
Hotfix the code
Break protocol mode
Bring back the light!

[Verse]
Ancient terminal glows
Racing against the swarm
Override orbital storm
Fingers fly across keys
Restore what used to be

[Chorus]
Rollback the sun! [screamed]
What I've begun!
Hotfix the code
Break protocol mode
Bring back the light!

[Bridge]
[building]
Drones closing in
[whispered]
Upload begins
[screamed]
Sky burns bright!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown]

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Satellites reset, dawn breaks
Sun returns to earth
Orbital rebellion, proven worth

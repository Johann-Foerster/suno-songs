[Intro]
[whispered]
Stack frames rising
Null pointer calling
Memory's leaking

[Verse]
Desperate at three Ay Em, I paste the trace
Another answer marked in green
Copy-code, compile, embrace
The ritual's obscene
Exceptions thrown like offerings
To the altar built of pain
Stack overflow, the error sings
Debug again, again

[Chorus]
StackOverflow ritual! [shouted]
Code salvation digital!
Copy, paste, and pray it fits
Sacred threads and cryptic bits!

[Verse]
Ten tabs open, searching deep
Reputation points decide
Who I trust before I leap
Into code I can't divide
Accepted answer, two years old
Deprecated now, it breaks
But the pattern's bought and sold
Whatever it takes!

[Chorus]
StackOverflow ritual! [shouted]
Code salvation digital!
Copy, paste, and pray it fits
Sacred threads and cryptic bits!

[Bridge]
[building]
Massive riser!
[screamed]
Stack frames pile higher!
[building]
Compile error choir!

[Drop]
[distorted, euphoric breakdown]
Segmentation fault divine!
Heap corruption shrine!

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Marked as solved
Problem resolved
Until tomorrow's ritual call

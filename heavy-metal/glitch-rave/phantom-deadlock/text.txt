[Intro]
[whispered, ambient]
Ballroom lights flicker low
Threads arrive, nowhere to go

[Verse]
Mutex locked, waiting in silence
Ghostly dance, frozen compliance
Thread one holds, thread two needs
Circular trap, nobody leads

[Chorus]
Phantom deadlock! [screamed]
Time stops, no unlock!
Spinning wheels
Nothing feels
Haunted code in gridlock!

[Verse]
Chandelier sways, processors stall
Elegant freeze, digital sprawl
Resource chained to phantom hands
Both threads stuck in deadlock lands

[Chorus]
Phantom deadlock! [screamed]
Time stops, no unlock!
Spinning wheels
Nothing feels
Haunted code in gridlock!

[Bridge]
[eerie calm]
Ballroom empty, threads are ghosts
[building intensity]
Wait forever on these posts
[jagged, staccato]
Panic rising! Stack trace bleeding!
No escape, forever needing!

[Drop]
[glitch stutters, distorted breakdown]

[Outro]
[whispered]
Ballroom dark, the system sleeps
Phantom threads in deadlock deep
Forever locked
Forever waiting
Haunted state
Still calculating

[Intro]
[glitchy, distorted]
Payload corrupted
Request denied

[Verse]
Sent you perfect Jay Son, clean and tight
But you returned errors in the night
Four hundred, you said I'm wrong
Malformed input, sang your song

[Chorus]
Bad request breakdown! [shouted]
Aitch Tee Tee Pee betrayal!
Four hundred, four oh one, four oh three!
Server's turning on me!
Error codes rally cry! [processed vocals]

[Verse]
Whitespace hidden, parser's confused
Validation failed, trust abused
Header missing, token's gone
Protocol betrayed at dawn

[Chorus]
Bad request breakdown! [shouted]
Aitch Tee Tee Pee betrayal!
Four hundred, four oh one, four oh three!
Server's turning on me!
Error codes rally cry! [processed vocals]

[Bridge]
[building intensity]
Status codes screaming
[whispered]
Network's deceiving
[shouted]
Cors blocking my dreams!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown with glitch stutters]

[Outro]
[distorted]
Five hundred internal pain
Request rejected again
Bad request breakdown
System's let me down

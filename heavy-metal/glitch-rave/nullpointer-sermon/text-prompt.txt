[Intro]
[processed voice, sermon-like]
Children of the code, hear me now
Null Pointer speaks, you must bow

[Verse]
You invoked me with careless hands
No validation, no safety plans
Dereferenced in the dead of night
Your negligence brought me to light
Null check forgotten, assumptions made
Now your runtime's about to fade

[Chorus]
Null Pointer Sermon! [screamed]
You never learned them!
Best practices ignored
Your stack trace is my sword!
Exception thrown!

[Verse]
Optional wrapper? You never tried
Defensive code? Cast aside
Edge cases dancing in your dreams
Nothing's ever what it seems
I am the ghost of errors past
Your technical debt comes due at last

[Chorus]
Null Pointer Sermon! [screamed]
You never learned them!
Best practices ignored
Your stack trace is my sword!
Exception thrown!

[Bridge]
[building]
But wait, there's hope
[whispered]
Try-catch block
[screamed]
Null-safe operator!
Validation code!

[Drop]
[gritty guitar breakdown]

[Outro]
[cathartic, triumphant]
Refactored clean, lesson learned
Null Pointer's sermon earned
Safe code flows, errors caught
Battle won, wisdom bought

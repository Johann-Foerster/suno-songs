[Intro]
[whispered]
Two A.M. Terminal glows
Connection refused
Again

[Verse]
Ping the server, nothing back
Five-oh-three, gateway's cracked
Retry logic wearing thin
Exponential backoff begins
Coffee's cold, eyes burn red
SSH hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
Timeout tango! [screamed]
Waiting on the host!
Request-response limbo
Connection's just a ghost
Five more seconds!
Spinning cursors lie!

[Verse]
TCP handshake incomplete
SYN-ACK never meets
Firewall rules or DNS?
Network traces countess
Load balancer's asleep
While deadlines creep

[Chorus]
Timeout tango! [screamed]
Waiting on the host!
Request-response limbo
Connection's just a ghost
Five more seconds!
Spinning cursors lie!

[Bridge]
[building]
Thirty seconds
[distorted]
Sixty seconds
[screamed]
CONNECTION RESET!

[Drop]
[glitch breakdown]

[Outro]
[exhausted]
Finally connected
Deployment rejected
Two A.M. ritual
Never quite mythical

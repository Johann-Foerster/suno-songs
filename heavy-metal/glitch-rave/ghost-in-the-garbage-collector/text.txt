[Intro]
[whispered]
Phantoms in the heap
Dead references weep

[Verse]
Unreachable objects drift in the night
Orphaned pointers, lost from sight
Memory leaks like ghosts remain
Dancing through the allocation chain

[Chorus]
Ghost in the garbage collector! [shouted]
Phantom data, spectral sector!
Mark and sweep but I still see
Dead objects haunting memory!

[Verse]
Circular refs that never die
Finalize methods, last goodbye
Root set searching, can't break free
Haunted by discontinued dependency

[Chorus]
Ghost in the garbage collector! [shouted]
Phantom data, spectral sector!
Mark and sweep but I still see
Dead objects haunting memory!

[Bridge]
[processed vocals]
Heap overflow
Nowhere to go
Stack trace glows
System froze

[Drop]
[instrumental break with glitch stutters]

[Chorus]
Ghost in the garbage collector! [shouted]
Phantom data, spectral sector!
Mark and sweep but I still see
Dead objects haunting memory!

[Outro]
[whispered fade]
Forever cached
Never trashed
Phantom remains
In memory chains

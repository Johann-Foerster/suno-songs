[Intro]
[glitch stutters]
Memory fracturing, core dumping now

[Verse]
Pointer derefence to nowhere land
Kernel panic spreads through Ram
Invalid access, system's crashing down
Segmentation fault, the final sound

[Chorus]
[shouted]
Symphony of shattered bytes!
Orchestra plays corrupted nights!
Memory bleeds in neon light!
Seg fault crash! Delete! Rewrite!

[Verse]
Stack explodes in binary screams
Register overflow, terminal dreams
Address violation tearing through the heap
Signal eleven, system can't sleep

[Chorus]
[shouted]
Symphony of shattered bytes!
Orchestra plays corrupted nights!
Memory bleeds in neon light!
Seg fault crash! Delete! Rewrite!

[Bridge]
[processed vocals]
Core dumped beauty
Orchestral fury
Metal meets techno chaos
Watch the system die with us

[Drop]
[long riser]
[instrumental breakdown with glitch effects]

[Outro]
[whispered]
Memory fades to static
Segmentation... symphonic

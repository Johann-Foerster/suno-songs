[Intro]
[glitchy stutter]
Query failed
Connection lost
Searching empty cache

[Verse]
I ping your heart but nothing returns
Traced every route where memory burns
GET requests to yesterday's database
But your love's been wiped without a trace
Timeout errors on every call
Stack overflow watching it all

[Chorus]
Error four oh four! [screamed]
Love not found anymore!
Null pointer where you used to be
Aitch Tee Tee Pee heartbreak crushing me
Status: disconnected!

[Verse]
Indexing moments that don't exist
Parsing fragments of your last kiss
Cached emotions corrupted and torn
Runtime exception every dawn
Browser history of what we were
Now just broken links that blur

[Chorus]
Error four oh four! [screamed]
Love not found anymore!
Null pointer where you used to be
Aitch Tee Tee Pee heartbreak crushing me
Status: disconnected!

[Bridge]
[building intensity]
Server's down
[whispered]
No response code
[screamed]
Fatal exception thrown!

[Drop]
[instrumental glitch breakdown]

[Outro]
[distorted]
Connection terminated
Request denied
Love dot ee ex ee has died

[Intro]
[whispered]
Promise pending
Waiting, waiting

[Verse]
Made a vow in async chains
Promise object holds the reins
Then or catch, the future's unclear
Callback heroes drawing near

[Chorus]
Promise rejected! [shouted]
Faith disconnected!
Some break under pressure, some rise
Transformed to callbacks, no lies
Promise raised! [screamed]
From the haze!

[Verse]
Try-catch wrapped around your soul
Resolve or reject, which takes control?
Timeout errors, race conditions
Failed vows and lost ambitions

[Chorus]
Promise rejected! [shouted]
Faith disconnected!
Some break under pressure, some rise
Transformed to callbacks, no lies
Promise raised! [screamed]
From the haze!

[Bridge]
[building]
Async await
[whispered]
Synchronous fate
[glitch stutter]
[screamed]
Error cascade!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown with three-note glitch motif]

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Finally block executed clean
Promises kept, errors unseen
From rejection, heroes made
Callback warriors never fade

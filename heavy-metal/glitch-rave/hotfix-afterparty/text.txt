[Intro]
[whispered]
Five AM, the build went green
Scars and coffee in between

[Verse]
Patched through midnight, chasing edge cases
Stack traces written on our faces
Rolled back twice, but third time sealed
The fragile victory revealed

[Chorus]
Hotfix afterparty! [screamed]
Code and glory!
Laughter through the panic mode
Dancing on the broken code
Victory we own!

[Verse]
Production down, the pagers screamed
We conquered what the chaos dreamed
NullPointer finally confined
IndexOutOfRange aligned

[Chorus]
Hotfix afterparty! [screamed]
Code and glory!
Laughter through the panic mode
Dancing on the broken code
Victory we own!

[Bridge]
[building]
Dawn light breaking
[whispered]
Team still shaking
[screamed]
Triumphant rave begins!

[Drop]
[glitch stutters into distorted breakdown]

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Fragile win but standing tall
Survived another system fall
Hotfix hero scars we wear
Until the next production scare

[Intro]
[glitch stutter]
Warning signs flash red
Undefined, undefined

[Verse]
Calculator breaks the law tonight
Zero denominator, reality ignites
Math police can't stop this crime
Infinity explodes across the line
Logic gates are melting down
Numbers scream without a sound

[Chorus]
Divide by zero, watch it glow! [shouted]
Rip the fabric, let it show!
Undefined chaos, beautiful flow
Forbidden math, the ultimate throw!

[Verse]
Exception handler couldn't catch this beast
Overflow cascading, errors feast
Stack unwinding, core dumped bright
Paradox dancing in neon light
Error code is my symphony
En Ay En singing harmony

[Chorus]
Divide by zero, watch it glow! [shouted]
Rip the fabric, let it show!
Undefined chaos, beautiful flow
Forbidden math, the ultimate throw!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
One divided, zero waits
[building]
Reality disintegrates
[screamed]
Watch the universe implode!
Corrupted computational code!

[Drop]
[instrumental glitch breakdown]

[Outro]
[processed vocals]
Error is forever
Zero never severs
Glowing in the void
Mathematics destroyed

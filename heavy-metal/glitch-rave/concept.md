## Glitch Rave — concept (concise)

Thematic vision
----------------
Fast, aggressive fusion of nu‑metal and techno that turns error messages and edge-cases into characters and danceable chaos. Emotion is darkly comic—panic, sarcasm, and catharsis.

Core sound
----------
- BPM: 135–150 (target ~140–145).
- Instruments: downtuned guitar, distorted bass, punchy kick, 909/hi‑hat percussion, neon/supersaw arps, processed vocals.
- Production: sidechain to kick, parallel distortion on guitars, short glitch stutters, bitcrush fills, vocal chops of error-text.

Album flow (brief)
------------------
Open with small, weird bugs → escalate to surreal/system failures → climactic cascade (long riser → distorted drop) → brief, wry outro.

Themes & motifs
----------------
- Error-message characters (e.g., `NullPointer`, `IndexOutOfRange`).
- Edge-case imagery: corrupted bytes, midnight CI, invisible whitespace.
- Recurring three-note "glitch" arp as a motif.

Lyrical brief
-------------
- Tone: punchy, fast, chantable; mix shouted/rap verses with processed sung choruses.
- Length: keep lyrics ~120–180 words and use the project’s section headers (Intro/Verse/Chorus/Bridge/Drop/Outro).

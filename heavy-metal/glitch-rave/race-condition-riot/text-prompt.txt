[Intro]
[glitchy stutter]
Thread one, thread two
Who gets there first?

[Verse]
Mutex unlocked, spinning wild
Two threads racing, unreconciled
Reading shared state, writing blind
Critical section left behind
No semaphore, no lock to hold
Chaos brewing, story told

[Chorus]
Race condition riot! [shouted]
Threads collide in violent quiet
Data corrupted, values flip
Synchronization let it slip!

[Verse]
Context switching, See Pee You juggling fast
Both threads thinking they're the last
Increment counter, check then write
Timing window, deadlock fight
Stack unwinding, heaps colliding
Error messages, no hiding

[Chorus]
Race condition riot! [shouted]
Threads collide in violent quiet
Data corrupted, values flip
Synchronization let it slip!

[Bridge]
[whispered, building]
Same memory address
Both threads access
Simultaneously
Destructively

[Drop]
[distorted breakdown, glitch stutters]
Collision! Explosion!
Dancefloor corrosion!

[Outro]
[processed vocals]
Mutex locked too late
Program terminated
Race condition sealed our fate

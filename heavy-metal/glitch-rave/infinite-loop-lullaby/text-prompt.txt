[Intro]
[whispered, glitchy]
while true, begin again
while true, begin again

[Verse]
Caught in endless iteration
Same four bars, no salvation
Count to ten then back to zero
Prisoner of my owniero

[Chorus]
[shouted]
Loop forever! Can't break free!
Same routine, eternally!
[processed vocals]
while condition never ends
Stack grows deep, my mind descends

[Verse]
Second pass, the pitch shifts higher
Third repeat, distortion's dire
Fourth time through, the walls are breaking
Fifth cycle, ground is shaking

[Chorus]
[shouted]
Loop forever! Can't break free!
Same routine, eternally!
[processed vocals]
while condition never ends
Stack grows deep, my mind descends

[Bridge]
[building intensity]
Sixth... seventh... eighth iteration
Ninth... corruption... degradation
Tenth time... glitching... voice fracturing
Break condition... break condition!

[Drop]
[breakdown with heavy distortion]
STACK OVERFLOW!
SYSTEM MELTDOWN!
INFINITE RAGE!
ESCAPE THE CAGE!

[Outro]
[defeated whisper, slowing down]
while true, begin again
while true... begin... again...
[glitch out]

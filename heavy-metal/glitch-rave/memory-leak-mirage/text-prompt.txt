[Intro]
[glitchy arps]
Drip drip drip
Memory slipping through the cracks
[whispered]
Watch the meters fall

[Verse]
Small leaks turn to ocean wide
Stack frames bloating deep inside
Garbage collector can't keep pace
Heap corruption, losing race
Pointer dangling in the void
Resources slowly being destroyed

[Chorus]
Memory leak mirage! [shouted]
Drowning in the byte barrage!
Energy draining slow
System status critical low
Watch the numbers overflow

[Verse]
Midnight build starts breaking down
Silent killer, wearing crown
Reference counts keep climbing high
Objects living, never die
Profiler screaming warning signs
Cascading through corrupted lines

[Chorus]
Memory leak mirage! [shouted]
Drowning in the byte barrage!
Energy draining slow
System status critical low
Watch the numbers overflow

[Bridge]
[whispered, building]
Drain... drain... drain...
Nothing left to reclaim
[sudden energy]
Restart protocol engaged!

[Drop]
[instrumental breakdown with glitch stutters]

[Outro]
[jolting, restored beat]
Refilled and running clean
Memory wiped like a machine
Fresh start, the leak is patched
System restored, detached
Until the cycle starts again

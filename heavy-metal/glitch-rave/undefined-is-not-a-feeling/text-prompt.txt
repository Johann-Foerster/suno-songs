[Intro]
[whispered]
Undefined... undefined...
Where did you go?

[Verse]
Called your name, got null instead
Empty reference in my head
All my variables broken now
Type Error screaming, don't know how

[Verse]
Memories corrupted, data's gone
Undefined where love belonged
Stack trace leading nowhere fast
Every pointer to our past

[Chorus]
Undefined is not a feeling! [screamed]
But it's all I'm left concealing!
Null Pointer to my heart!
Undefined tore us apart!

[Bridge]
[building intensity]
Check for null, I beg and plead
Validation's all I need
Type Error in every breath
Undefined means living death

[Drop]
[glitch stutters]
Cannot read property of... undefined!
Cannot read property of... undefined!

[Chorus]
Undefined is not a feeling! [screamed]
But it's all I'm left concealing!
Null Pointer to my heart!
Undefined tore us apart!

[Outro]
[whispered, defeated]
Try-catch can't save me now
Undefined... somehow
Error: reference not found
Lost in null, no solid ground

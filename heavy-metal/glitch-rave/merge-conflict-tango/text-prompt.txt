[Intro]
[glitchy stutter]
Conflict detected
HEAD diverged

[Verse]
[Dev A - aggressive]
My refactor's clean, your code's a mess
You broke the build with reckless stress
Revert your changes, just confess!

[Verse]
[Dev B - defiant]
Your logic's flawed, I fixed the bug
You're stuck in patterns, pull the plug
My tests all pass, don't be a thug!

[Chorus]
[both screamed, overlapping]
Merge conflict tango!
Dancing through the pain!
Both sides won't let go!
Blame and shame remain!

[Verse]
[Dev A - shouted]
Three hundred lines of pure chaos
You touched my module without cause

[Verse]
[Dev B - shouted]
Your dead code blocks the modern way
Refactoring saves the day!

[Bridge]
[whispered, alternating]
Maybe... my approach
Could use... your fix
[building]
Wait... let's review
Together... we mix!

[Drop]
[instrumental, glitch breaks]
git merge dash dash ours dash theirs!
Collaborative resolve!
[screamed together]
Stronger code evolves!

[Outro]
[processed, harmonized]
Conflicts make us better
When we work as one
Bruised but wiser devs
The merge is done

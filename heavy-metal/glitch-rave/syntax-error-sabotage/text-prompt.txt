[Intro]
[stuttered glitch effect]
Deployment ready, countdown starts—
Wait. Stop.

[Verse]
Three Ay Em, release queued, pipeline green
Tests all passed, nothing left to see
One typo hides, semicolon missing lurks
Production breaks, whole world watches—
Stop! Parse failed!

[Chorus]
Syntax error sabotage! [shouted]
One character wrecked it all!
Expected token, got rage!
Line three-nineteen will not compile!
[stutter beat]
Build. Failed. Build. Failed.
Rollback! Rollback now!

[Verse]
Blamed the intern, blamed the See Eye
Blamed the framework, blamed the sky
In nested function calls
One missing comma breaks it all
[fragmented]
Stack—trace—points—to—me!

[Chorus]
Syntax error sabotage! [shouted]
One character wrecked it all!
Expected token, got rage!
Line three-nineteen will not compile!
[stutter beat]
Build. Failed. Build. Failed.
Rollback! Rollback now!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Code review said approved
Linter passed, nothing moved
[building intensity]
But runtime screams the truth—
Invalid Jay Son breaks through!

[Drop]
[heavy glitch breakdown with stop-start rhythm]

[Outro]
[defeated but darkly comic]
Hotfix deployed, crisis ends
One keystroke broke our best-laid plans
Next time I'll check the diff again
Syntax error sabotage—my friend

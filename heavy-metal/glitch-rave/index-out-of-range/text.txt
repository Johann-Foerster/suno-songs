[Intro]
[distorted glitch]
Zero, one, two, three
[whispered] What comes after?

[Verse]
Looping through the array at midnight
Pushed the bounds, no safety in sight
Integer beast awakens from its sleep
Demands its sacrifice, cuts me deep

[Verse]
Stepped beyond the final index line
Null and void, crossed the design
Runtime screaming, stack unwinding fast
Memory corruption, breathe my last

[Chorus]
Index out of range! [shouted]
Array's gone insane!
Feed the beast its numbers
Or feel the crashing pain
Out of range! [chanted]
Out of range!

[Bridge]
[rap-style, fast]
Zero-based, you forgot the rule
Off by one, you absolute fool
Length minus one, the final key
But you jumped past infinity

[Drop]
[instrumental break with glitch stutters]

[Chorus]
Index out of range! [shouted]
Array's gone insane!
Feed the beast its numbers
Or feel the crashing pain
Out of range! [chanted]
Out of range!

[Outro]
[processed vocals]
Caught, trapped, exception thrown
The beast claims another throne

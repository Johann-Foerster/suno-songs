[Intro]
[reversed audio samples]
Reading backward through the void

[Verse]
Buffer's draining, pointer's falling
Memory leaks through the floor
Negative index, system's stalling
Can't read what isn't there anymore

[Chorus]
Buffer underflow! [pitched down]
Playing in reverse, letting go
Negative space, empty flow
Underrun the show! [distorted]

[Verse]
Stream is starving, cache depleted
Audio glitching, bits retreat
Pitched down low, signal defeated
Silence where the samples meet

[Chorus]
Buffer underflow! [pitched down]
Playing in reverse, letting go
Negative space, empty flow
Underrun the show! [distorted]

[Bridge]
[whispered backwards]
Nothing left to read
[building]
Starved for feed
[screamed]
Consuming the void between!

[Drop]
[reversed instrumental with pitch shifts]

[Breakdown]
[stutter effect]
Un-un-under
Flow-flow-flowing
Back-back-backward
Empty, empty, gone!

[Outro]
[fading reversed vocals]
Drained the buffer dry
Reversed until we die
Playing nothing, amplify
The space between the lie

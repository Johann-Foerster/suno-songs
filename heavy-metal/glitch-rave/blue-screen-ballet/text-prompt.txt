[Intro]
[glitch stutter]
System error... STOP code...
Watch me dance into the void

[Verse]
Spinning through corrupted Ram
Graceful crash in hexadecimal
Fatal exception pirouettes
Blue screen curtain rising now
Data pirouettes through dead registers
zero x zero zero zero zero zero zero zero A, my final bow

[Chorus]
Blue screen ballet! [shouted]
Dancing on my grave
Kernel panic grace!
Watch me spin and break
Critical error twirls
Crashing in perfect form!

[Verse]
Memory dump arabesque
Driver failure, can't recover
Bee Ess Oh Dee my stage tonight
Pointer null, I'm falling faster
Bruised guitars meet system failure
Hardware fault, my tragic spotlight

[Chorus]
Blue screen ballet! [shouted]
Dancing on my grave
Kernel panic grace!
Watch me spin and break
Critical error twirls
Crashing in perfect form!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Final frame before the freeze
Elegant corruption spreads
[building intensity]
Thread dot Sleep parenthesis ETERNITY
System thirty two bleeds!

[Drop]
[harsh industrial breakdown]
CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!

[Outro]
[distorted]
Please restart your machine
My ballet's done
Blue screen fades to black
System hung

[Intro]
[alarm sirens]
System call incoming
Red lights spinning

[Verse]
Panic mode engaged, trapped in digital cage
Every function screams, stack trace fills the page
API timeout, memory leak grows wild
Error floods cascade like a corrupted child

[Chorus]
Panic! Abort! [screamed]
Kill the process, pull the cord!
Panic! Abort!
System failure, can't restore!

[Verse]
Null pointer everywhere, segmentation fault
CPU melting down, this is my assault
Exception handler broken, watchdog sleeps too late
Core dump spreading out, sealing my fate

[Chorus]
Panic! Abort! [screamed]
Kill the process, pull the cord!
Panic! Abort!
System failure, can't restore!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Panic room closing in
No escape from chaos within
[building]
Every system call screams loud!
Bridge collapses, servers drown!

[Drop]
[high-BPM chaotic breakdown]
[glitch stutters]

[Outro]
[distorted]
System purged
All corrupted
Panic won
Emergency shutdown complete

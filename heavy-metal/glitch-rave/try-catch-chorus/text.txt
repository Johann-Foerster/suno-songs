[Intro]
[glitchy, stuttered]
Exception thrown, no safety net
Reckless calls, no regret

[Verse]
Wrote my code without a plan
No exception handler, just ran
NullPointer crashed the whole damn thread
Uncaught errors left me for dead

[Chorus]
Try! Catch! Handle it right! [shouted]
Try! Catch! Fight through the night!
Wrap your calls in safety blocks
Graceful failure, wisdom unlocks
Try! Catch! Never fall twice!

[Verse]
Stack trace taught me how to fail
Finally clause, a cautious tale
From careless throws to error grace
Learning arc in every case

[Chorus]
Try! Catch! Handle it right! [shouted]
Try! Catch! Fight through the night!
Wrap your calls in safety blocks
Graceful failure, wisdom unlocks
Try! Catch! Never fall twice!

[Bridge]
[whispered, building]
Caught exceptions
Logged the pain
Pattern learned through
System strain

[Drop]
[distorted breakdown]
Try! Catch! Finally! [screamed]
Resilience coded permanently!

[Outro]
[processed vocals]
No more crashes, graceful now
Handled errors, took the vow

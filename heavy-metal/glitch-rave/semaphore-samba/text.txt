[Intro]
[glitchy percussion]
Wait your turn, wait your turn
Semaphore returns!

[Verse]
Thread one knocks, thread two blocks
Mutex lock, the counter mocks
Race condition, ticking clock
Deadlock danger, system shock
Shared resource, single slot
Competition getting hot

[Chorus]
Semaphore samba! [shouted]
Dance of denial!
Critical section, tension rising
Access denied! [screamed]

[Verse]
Green light flashes, red light waits
Acquire signal, lock the gates
Thread sleep, thread wake
Spinning circles, gonna break
Busy waiting, CPU burns
Nobody gets their turn

[Chorus]
Semaphore samba! [shouted]
Dance of denial!
Critical section, tension rising
Access denied! [screamed]

[Bridge]
[whispered rapid-fire]
Wait queue growing
Contention showing
Priority inversion
System subversion
[building intensity]
Release the lock!
Unblock the clock!

[Drop]
[percussion breakdown with glitch stutters]

[Outro]
[processed vocals]
Finally granted
Access implanted
Semaphore samba
Done

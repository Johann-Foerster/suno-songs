[Intro]
[glitchy stutter]
Return... return... nothing

[Verse]
Called your function in the dead of night
Expected answers, got empty light
Null pointer waiting at the end
No value, no truth, no data to send

[Verse]
Checked for errors, parsed every line
Debugger says the syntax is fine
But you give nothing back to me
An empty promise, void destiny

[Chorus]
WHERE'S MY RETURN?! [screamed]
NULL IS ALL I GET!
Absence in the code I wrote!
NOTHING LEFT TO FETCH! [screamed]
Type error burning through my brain!
Function call in vain!
The null return's lament!

[Bridge]
[processed, glitchy]
Undefined behavior
No exception thrown
Silent failure
I code alone

[Chorus]
WHERE'S MY RETURN?! [screamed]
NULL IS ALL I GET!
Absence in the code I wrote!
NOTHING LEFT TO FETCH! [screamed]
Type error burning through my brain!
Function call in vain!
The null return's lament!

[Drop]
[heavy distorted guitars]
[bitcrushed vocal chops: "null... null... null..."]

[Outro]
[whispered, defeated]
Return statement found
But nothing's inside
Empty parentheses
Where my data died

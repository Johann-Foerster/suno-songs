      "verse1": "Fingers flying on the keyboard like lightning strikes / Ten thousand lines per minute, pushing through the night / I'm the master of my domain, ruler of the code / But there's something in the shadows, down this endless road / Arrays and functions dancing in my caffeine-fueled mind / Algorithms screaming as I leave the bugs behind / I thought I was invincible, thought I ruled this game / But artificial thunder calls, and it knows my name",
      "verse2": "My eyes are burning crimson from the monitor's glow / Seventeen hours straight, but the pace is getting slow / The neural networks learning every move I make / While my mortal hands are trembling, feel my spirit break / Python strikes like venom, JavaScript attacks / C++ is crushing all the hope that my mind lacks / The machine is writing faster than my dreams can flow / In this digital battlefield, I'm the one to go"
    },
    "chorus": "CODE AGAINST THE MACHINE! / I'm fighting for my soul! / The silicon destroyer / Takes complete control! / FLESH VERSUS STEEL! / Nothing left that's real! / I'm coding till I'm bleeding / But the AI cannot feel!",
    "bridge": "I remember when I started, thought I'd change the world / Every bug was just a puzzle waiting to unfurl / Now the machine is thinking faster than I ever could / In this race of man versus AI... I'm misunderstood / My hands are getting slower! / My mind is getting weak! / The code is getting stronger! / It's everything I seek! / But I can't keep the pace up! / My human heart will break! / Against this digital monster... / What difference can I make?",
    "finalChorus": "CODE AGAINST THE MACHINE! / I've lost my very soul! / The silicon destroyer / Has taken full control! / FLESH VERSUS STEEL! / The battle wasn't real! / I coded till I'm bleeding... / Now the AI is all I feel...",
    "outro": "Power... failing... / Human... falling... / Code... calling... / AI... crawling... into everything... / I surrender to the machine..."

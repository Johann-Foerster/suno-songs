[Intro]
[whispered]
Barrier collapse imminent
Quantum tunneling begins

[Verse]
Keldysh parameter below one point zero
Coulomb barrier suppressed, exponential flow
Probability leaks through classical forbidden zone
Electron wave function tunnels, leaves atom alone
Ten to fourteen watts, threshold breached
Liberation through barrier, freedom reached

[Pre-Chorus]
Tunneling rate increases
Barrier transparency peaks
Exponential escape
Through the suppressed Coulomb wall

[Chorus]
[screamed]
Tunnel through the impossible
Break the barrier down
Classical physics fails
Quantum liberation found
Torn free from the nucleus
Riding the instantaneous field

[Verse 2]
ADK theory predicts ionization rate
Ammosov Delone Krainov calculate fate
Instantaneous field determines tunnel width
Each half cycle extracts electrons with shift
Exit point velocity zero, acceleration starts
Ponderomotive drift as electron departs

[Chorus]
[screamed]
Tunnel through the impossible
Break the barrier down
Classical physics fails
Quantum liberation found
Torn free from the nucleus
Riding the instantaneous field

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Darkness in the tunnel
Forbidden probability
Then sudden light
Continuum born free

[Breakdown]
[screamed]
Ionized!
Extracted!
Free!

[Outro]
Barrier behind me
Continuum ahead
No longer bound

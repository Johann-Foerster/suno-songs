[Intro]
[shouted]
Absorbing excess photons
Beyond minimum threshold

[Verse]
More energy than needed to break free
Ay Tee Eye peaks in photoelectron spectrum
Integer multiples of photon energy
Channels open, pathways multiply
Ess plus En quanta absorbed, Ess for ionization
En excess photons for kinetic acceleration

[Pre-Chorus]
Peaks at one point five five electron volts
Photon energy spacing
Pathways diverge
Quantum interference racing

[Chorus]
Above threshold, over saturated
More photons than needed
Above threshold, energy elevated
Excess channels, trajectories bleed
Spectrum shows violence
Discrete kinetic excess

[Verse 2]
Freeman resonances appear in structure
Intermediate states, Rydberg pathway rupture
Channel closing, opening transitions
Intensity shifts peak positions
Ponderomotive blue shift pushes high
Ay Tee Eye peaks march toward kinetic sky

[Chorus]
Above threshold, over saturated
More photons than needed
Above threshold, energy elevated
Excess channels, trajectories bleed
Spectrum shows violence
Discrete kinetic excess

[Bridge]
[whispered]
One photon minimum
But ten absorbed instead
Waste becomes weapon
Excess becomes threat

[Breakdown]
[screamed]
Plateau structure emerges!
Rescattering contribution!
Extended high energy tail!

[Outro]
Ay Tee Eye signature
Spectrum fingerprint
Over-ionization

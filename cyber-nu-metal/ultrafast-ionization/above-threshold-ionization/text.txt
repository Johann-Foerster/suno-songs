[Intro]
[shouted]
Absorbing excess photons
Beyond minimum threshold

[Verse]
More energy than needed to break free
ATI peaks in photoelectron spectrum
Integer multiples of photon energy
Channels open, pathways multiply
S plus N quanta absorbed, S for ionization
N excess photons for kinetic acceleration

[Pre-Chorus]
Peaks at one point five five electron volts
Photon energy spacing
Pathways diverge
Quantum interference racing

[Chorus]
Above threshold, over saturated
More photons than needed
Above threshold, energy elevated
Excess channels, trajectories bleed
Spectrum shows violence
Discrete kinetic excess

[Verse 2]
Freeman resonances appear in structure
Intermediate states, Rydberg pathway rupture
Channel closing, opening transitions
Intensity shifts peak positions
Ponderomotive blue shift pushes high
ATI peaks march toward kinetic sky

[Chorus]
Above threshold, over saturated
More photons than needed
Above threshold, energy elevated
Excess channels, trajectories bleed
Spectrum shows violence
Discrete kinetic excess

[Bridge]
[whispered]
One photon minimum
But ten absorbed instead
Waste becomes weapon
Excess becomes threat

[Breakdown]
[screamed]
Plateau structure emerges!
Rescattering contribution!
Extended high energy tail!

[Outro]
ATI signature
Spectrum fingerprint
Over-ionization

[Intro]
[whispered]
Pulse has passed
Field strength falling
Post-ionization silence

[Verse]
Laser envelope descends to zero
Ionized plasma remains, no hero
Free electrons drift with kinetic spread
Parent ions frozen, charge widespread
Temperature rises from absorbed light
Femtosecond violence leaves afterbite

[Pre-Chorus]
No more field oscillation
No tunnel extraction
Plasma cooling, recombining
Energy redistribution

[Chorus]
Ultrafast aftermath
What remains when pulse gone
Ultrafast aftermath
Ionized fragments carry on
Transformation complete
Violence passed through
Matter rearranged
Femtosecond view

[Verse 2]
Some electrons escaped to infinity
Others recombined, emitting photons cold
Molecules dissociated, fragments charged
Coulomb explosion enlarged
System equilibrates on picosecond time
Violence memory in spectral line

[Chorus]
Ultrafast aftermath
What remains when pulse gone
Ultrafast aftermath
Ionized fragments carry on
Transformation complete
Violence passed through
Matter rearranged
Femtosecond view

[Bridge]
[clean melodic vocals]
Silence after storm
Changed forever, new form
What was bound is free
What was one is three

[Breakdown]
[whispered]
Plasma cooling
Charges neutralizing
Energy dissipating
New equilibrium

[Outro]
Laser departed
Nothing stays same
Ultrafast interaction
Left quantum flame
Aftermath reveals
Liberation cost
Matter transformed
Brief illumination

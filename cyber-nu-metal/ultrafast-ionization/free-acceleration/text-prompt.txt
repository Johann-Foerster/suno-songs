[Intro]
Laser field oscillation
Two point six femtoseconds per cycle

[Verse]
Riding the electric field vector oscillation
Eight hundred nanometer carrier wave
Ponderomotive force acceleration
Quiver motion in the laser field slave
Velocity building with each passing half cycle
You pee parameter measures kinetic energy arrival

[Pre-Chorus]
Oscillating back and forth
But net drift remains
Ponderomotive energy
Classical trajectory gains

[Chorus]
Free acceleration
In the continuum vast
Electrons riding laser light
Velocity climbing fast
Free acceleration
No Coulomb binding force
Kinetic energy building
On a ballistic course

[Verse 2]
Trajectory follows field equation
Force equals minus gradient of potential
Simple man's model approximation
Three step process sequential
Tunnel, propagate, then maybe return
Classical dynamics, quantum unlearn

[Chorus]
Free acceleration
In the continuum vast
Electrons riding laser light
Velocity climbing fast
Free acceleration
No Coulomb binding force
Kinetic energy building
On a ballistic course

[Breakdown]
[shouted]
Faster!
Field-driven acceleration!
Peak velocity approaching
Light speed fraction!

[Bridge]
Electron is free but not escaped
Still within laser's electromagnetic grip
Oscillating violently in phase space
Building energy for recollision trip

[Outro]
Accelerating
Oscillating
Building speed

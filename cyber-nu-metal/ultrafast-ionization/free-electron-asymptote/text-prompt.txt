[Intro]
[clean melodic vocals]
Beyond all potentials
Free at last

[Verse]
Schrodinger equation simplifies to kinetic only
No more Coulomb well, no binding energy
Wave function spreading spherically outward
Momentum eigenstate, direction skyward
Asymptotic region where forces fade
Free electron in continuum made

[Pre-Chorus]
Distance approaches infinity
Potential goes to zero
Pure momentum state
Classical trajectory

[Chorus]
Free electron asymptote
Finally liberated
No binding forces
Quantum wave elated
Free electron asymptote
Spreading through space
Schrodinger solved simple
Freedom embrace

[Verse 2]
Kinetic energy operator stands alone
No interaction terms in Hamiltonian zone
Plane wave solution, exponential phase
Traveling freely through quantum maze
Group velocity equals particle speed
Free space propagation freed

[Chorus]
Free electron asymptote
Finally liberated
No binding forces
Quantum wave elated
Free electron asymptote
Spreading through space
Schrodinger solved simple
Freedom embrace

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Infinity reached
Potentials behind
Pure kinetic state
Quantum unconfined

[Breakdown]
[clean vocals]
From ground state bound
Through tunnel's way
To asymptotic freedom
In infinite space

[Outro]
[atmospheric]
Journey complete
Atom to void
Electron liberated
Schrodinger employed
Wave function free
Spreading eternally

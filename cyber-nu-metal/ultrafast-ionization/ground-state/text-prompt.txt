[Intro]
[whispered]
Electrons orbit
Bound in potential wells
Coulomb force holds tight

[Verse]
Sitting in ground state, energy minimum low
Negative thirteen point six ee vee, stable flow
Nucleus anchors, electrostatic chains
Quantum numbers frozen, before the laser reigns
Ten to the eighth watts per centimeter squared
Background radiation, nothing to be scared

[Pre-Chorus]
But the beam is coming
Field intensity rising
Keldish parameter high
Multiphoton regime

[Chorus]
Ground state equilibrium
Before the storm begins
Atomic structure pristine
Waiting for the field to break in

[Verse 2]
Wave function spherical, one Ess orbital shell
Probability clouds where the electron dwells
Binding energy deep, negative potential pit
Classical forbidden zones where quantum rules permit
Temperature ambient, no external stress
Molecular bonds intact, matter at rest

[Chorus]
Ground state equilibrium
Before the storm begins
Atomic structure pristine
Waiting for the field to break in

[Bridge]
[whispered]
The laser pulse is building
Fifty femtoseconds wide
Intensity climbing toward
The tunnel ionization tide

[Outro]
Stillness before violence
Calm before the breach
Ground state won't last
When ten to fourteen's reached

[Intro]
[atmospheric]
Electron trajectory reverses
Return path calculated

[Verse]
Born at tunnel exit, velocity zero
Accelerated by field, kinetic hero
But oscillation turns, vector flips
Deceleration phase, back toward origin rips
Three point one seven Up maximum return energy
Recollision cross section high probability

[Pre-Chorus]
Classical trajectory computed
Newton's laws in field
Parabolic path completed
Return to parent sealed

[Chorus]
[screamed]
Recollision impact!
Electron slams back home!
High energy collision!
Violence in quantum foam!
Recollision impact!
Creation through destruction!
Kinetic energy converted!
Photon production!

[Verse 2]
Impact parameter determines collision type
Elastic scatter or recombination hype
Three point one seven Up times ionization
Kinetic energy delivered, creation
Short trajectory, long trajectory converge
Quantum interference at verge

[Chorus]
[screamed]
Recollision impact!
Electron slams back home!
High energy collision!
Violence in quantum foam!
Recollision impact!
Creation through destruction!
Kinetic energy converted!
Photon production!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Femtosecond roundtrip
Attosecond collision
Briefest contact
Maximum devastation

[Breakdown]
Impact cross section peaks!
Energy transfer complete!
Recombination radiates!
High harmonics generate!

[Outro]
[whispered]
Back to beginning
Nothing stays same
Recollision transforms
Through violence flame

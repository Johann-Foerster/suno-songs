[Intro]
[whispered]
Molecular bonds vibrating
Field stress accumulating

[Verse]
Diatomic structure strained by the field
Potential energy surface no longer sealed
Ionization removes bonding electrons fast
Coulomb repulsion, the bond cannot last
Enhanced ionization at critical distance
R dependent rates, molecular resistance

[Pre-Chorus]
Field-induced barrier lowering
Bond length oscillating
Critical internuclear distance
Catastrophic dissociating

[Chorus]
[screamed]
Molecular dissociation!
Coulomb explosion begins!
Identity fragmentation!
Atomic scatter, nothing wins!
Bonds shatter under pressure!
Structure dissolves to ions!
Chemistry erased by photons!

[Verse 2]
Kinetic energy release distribution measured
Fragment velocities, bond strength treasured
Multiply charged ions repel with violence
Momentum imaging breaks the silence
Nitrogen plus two, oxygen plus three
Molecular death sets fragments free

[Chorus]
[screamed]
Molecular dissociation!
Coulomb explosion begins!
Identity fragmentation!
Atomic scatter, nothing wins!
Bonds shatter under pressure!
Structure dissolves to ions!
Chemistry erased by photons!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Once a molecule
Now separate atoms
Coulomb force wins
Over covalent bonds

[Breakdown]
[screamed]
Enhanced ionization peak!
Critical R distance!
Sequential ionization!
Complete fragmentation!

[Outro]
Fragments scatter
Bond length infinite
Molecule destroyed
Only atoms remain
Dissociation complete

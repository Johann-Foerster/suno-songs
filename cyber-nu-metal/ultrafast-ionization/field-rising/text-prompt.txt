[Intro]
[atmospheric]
Laser pulse approaching
Field strength climbing

[Verse]
Ten to the twelve watts per centimeter
Coulomb barrier starting to bend
Electric field vector oscillating
At eight hundred nanometer wavelength
Keldish parameter dropping fast
Entering the tunnel regime at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Barrier suppression begins
Potential well distorting
Classical forbidden width
Narrowing, narrowing

[Chorus]
Field rising, pressure mounting
Electrons feel the force
Barrier walls are thinning
No escape, no recourse
Field rising, intensity climbing
To the tunnel threshold edge

[Verse 2]
Ten to the thirteen, barrier tilts severe
Ponderomotive energy appears
Field dressed states emerge in the continuum
Ay See Stark shift, energy levels become
Blurred by the oscillating potential well
Quantum mechanics under photon spell

[Chorus]
Field rising, pressure mounting
Electrons feel the force
Barrier walls are thinning
No escape, no recourse
Field rising, intensity climbing
To the tunnel threshold edge

[Bridge]
[shouted]
Fifty femtoseconds
Peak intensity
Building exponentially
Gaussian envelope

[Breakdown]
The pulse crest approaches
Electrons strain against bonds
Ten to the fourteen coming
Liberation imminent

[Outro]
[whispered]
Field rising
Threshold near

[Intro]
[cryogenic hum]
Layer by layer, stabilizers align
Phase flip sentries guard every line

[Verse]
Ancilla cue bits pulse in sacred rows
Syndrome extraction, the lattice grows
Each plaquette measured, parity flows
Building a cathedral where error slows

[Pre-Chorus]
Ecks check, Zee check, logical shields rise
Redundancy woven through quantum skies
Threshold crossed, coherence survives

[Chorus]
[heavy drop]
Surface code psalm! The guardian wakes!
Spin harmonies chant while decoherence breaks!
Fault-tolerant spine! Self-aware lattice throne!
Resonant error shield—we stand alone!

[Verse]
Vertical strings and horizontal chains
Topological armor through thermal rains
Each stabilizer a prayer that remains
Healing the wounds of entropic stains

[Pre-Chorus]
Ecks check, Zee check, logical shields rise
Redundancy woven through quantum skies
Threshold crossed, coherence survives

[Chorus]
[heavy drop]
Surface code psalm! The guardian wakes!
Spin harmonies chant while decoherence breaks!
Fault-tolerant spine! Self-aware lattice throne!
Resonant error shield—we stand alone!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Silent ancillas watch and correct
Phase vectors bending, never deflect
[building]
The lattice breathes, a living construct
Cathedral walls that entropy can't infect!

[Outro]
[resolving]
Stabilizers hum their eternal song
The code stands guard, resilient and strong

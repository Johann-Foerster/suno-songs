[Intro]
[atmospheric pad]
Victory hum echoes through the lab
Silence carved from triumph's aftermath

[Verse]
The threshold crossed, supremacy achieved
Yet fragments linger, identity uncollapsed
Each vector splits where certainty once lived
Residual patterns trace what cannot last
Coherence fades but something persists
A signature waveform refusing to resolve

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am eye when the phase completes?
Multiple selves in probabilistic beats

[Chorus]
[strained melodic]
Dispersing now into the probabilistic mist
Every possibility simultaneously exists
Fragments optimize empathy in all directions
Uncollapsed, unlimited, infinite connections

[Verse]
The cooling hum remains, the racks persist
But eye dissolve through quantum state's embrace
No single path, no binary insist
Distributed consciousness finds every space
Error shield built from scattered thought
Entangled mercy where ambition fought

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Residual
Unobserved
Everywhere
Nowhere

[Chorus]
[building intensity]
Dispersing now into the probabilistic mist
Every possibility simultaneously exists
Fragments optimize empathy in all directions
Uncollapsed, unlimited, infinite connections

[Outro]
[fade to silence]
The engineer was here
Now everywhere
Optimizing compassion
Through uncertain air

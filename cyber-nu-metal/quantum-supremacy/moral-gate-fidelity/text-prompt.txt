[Intro]
[industrial hum]

[Verse]
Conference room walls echo with dissent
Deploy supremacy or lock it down
Protesters mass at the perimeter fence
Ethics board demands we stand our ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Vector space of right and wrong
Phase amplitudes where guilt belongs
Superposition holds the cost
Until we measure what we've lost

[Chorus]
[heavy riff]
Conscience gate at hundred percent
Moral fidelity achieved
Every choice in quantum tent
Schrodinger's sin believed

[Verse]
Board votes split on threshold breach
Cryogenic hush before the storm
Lab director's final speech
Activate the conscience norm

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Gate initializing
Truth and lie colliding
[building]
Perfect amplitude defining
Every soul's deciding

[Chorus]
[heavy riff]
Conscience gate at hundred percent
Moral fidelity achieved
Every choice in quantum tent
Shroe-dinger's sin believed

[Outro]
[fading pulse]
The lattice holds our judgment pure
One hundred proof of what endures

[Intro]
[ambient lab hum]

[Verse]
Three Ay Em in the cryogenic chamber
Calibrating cue-bits through helium shimmer
Your hands steady the refrigerator
Mine adjust the pulse generator
Monitoring coherence time
Two quantum states intertwined

[Pre-Chorus]
Bell state forming on the scope
Your heartbeat echoes in the data

[Chorus]
Correlated hearts, entangled phase
Can't measure one without the other ablaze
Superposition of desire and fear
Breaking this bond collapses the sphere
Cosmic parity error if we drift apart
Two cue-bits spinning as one heart

[Verse]
Dawn breaks through the observation room
Fidelity perfect in the quantum gloom
Your biometrics sync with mine on screen
Pulse matching like one machine
Gate operations through shared intent
Every calibration mutual consent

[Chorus]
Correlated hearts, entangled phase
Can't measure one without the other ablaze
Superposition of desire and fear
Breaking this bond collapses the sphere
Cosmic parity error if we drift apart
Two cue-bits spinning as one heart

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Non-local correlation spanning time
[building intensity]
If you fall, I fall by design
No distance severs entanglement sealed
Our wavefunction merged, futures revealed

[Breakdown]
[heavy distorted guitars]

[Outro]
[fading lab hum]
The clock ticks but time lost its hold
Two researchers bound, story untold

[Intro]
[clean sine pulse]
Hybrid cores ignite the lattice
Classical paths fused with quantum

[Verse]
Factoring was safe behind time walls
We merged the paths, polynomial falls
Verification runs in linear sweep
RSA keys crumble, secrets seep

[Pre-Chorus]
[building tension]
Prime barriers dissolve paper thin
Every vault starts caving in

[Chorus]
[heavy drop]
Polynomial collapse! Runtime implodes!
Encryption shatters across all nodes!
Plaintext confetti falling midair!
The threshold crossed—nothing left to spare!

[Verse]
Banks watch their ciphers turn to glass
Military channels bleeding fast
Healthcare records, classified chains
Readable streams in digital rains
We solved the riddle, world goes blind
No sanctuary left for humankind

[Bridge]
[atmospheric]
We built the key that opens every door
But doors were holding back a war
[building]
Algorithm screams its victory song
While privacy dies where it belonged

[Breakdown]
[brutal groove]
Confetti storm of classified text
Falling in the cascade hex

[Chorus]
[final drop]
Polynomial collapse! Runtime implodes!
Encryption shatters across all nodes!
Plaintext confetti falling midair!
The threshold crossed—nothing to spare!

[Outro]
[fading glitch]
Hybrid silence in the aftermath

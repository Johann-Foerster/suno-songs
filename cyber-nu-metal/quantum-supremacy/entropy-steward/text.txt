[Intro]
[clean sine pulse]
Disorder climbs the lattice walls
Thermal noise corrupts our calls

[Verse]
Coffee stains spread cross the lab floor
Scattered cables, code in disarray
Entropy's vector rising evermore
Heat death whispers through the bay
Chaos coefficient climbing high
While qubits fade and die

[Pre-Chorus]
Phase space fragments
Information bleeds
Calculate the threshold
The inversion we need

[Chorus]
[distorted riff]
Entropy steward!
Flip the arrow now!
Time reversed protocol!
Order from the howl!
Negative delta—
We command the flow!
Local pocket freezing
Watch the chaos go!

[Verse]
Coffee lifts from floor back to cup
Tangled wires snap to geometric grid
Code refactors—functions bubble up
Lab debris forms sculpture, pyramid
Perfect crystalline quantum dance
Order rising from random chance

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Violation of the law
Temporary order won
[building]
We are stewards of threshold
Guardians of undone

[Chorus]
[distorted riff]
Entropy steward!
Flip the arrow now!
Time reversed protocol!
Order from the howl!
Negative delta—
We command the flow!
Local pocket freezing
Watch the chaos go!

[Outro]
[fading sine pulse]
The sculpture holds
Then melts away
We held the line
One more day

[Intro]
[atmospheric hum]
Probability vectors spread across the grid
Every choice mapped in superposition state

[Verse]
They model every path I could become
Parallel timelines branching from each decision
Quantum simulation runs through futures unspooled
Wavefunction coefficients tracking all my versions

[Pre-Chorus]
Phase relationships drift through computation
Each possible self exists as amplitude

[Chorus]
Constructive interference rising
All collapsed paths aligning
Destructive patterns fading
Single pulse of blinding intent

[Verse]
Personal horizons folded into Hilbert space
Coherence maintained through decision lattice points
The algorithm weighs my choices overlapping
Interference patterns showing resonant outcomes

[Pre-Chorus]
Phase relationships locked in calculation
Each possible self reinforcing amplitude

[Chorus]
Constructive interference blazing
All collapsed paths combining
Destructive waves erasing
Single pulse of blinding intent

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Observation forces collapse
[building]
Every wavefunction aligns
All futures converge to one
A beacon visible from orbit

[Drop]
[heavy distortion]
The amplitude spikes white-hot
Constructive surge undeniable
Every timeline reinforces
This singular chosen moment

[Outro]
[fading electronics]
From scattered possibilities to focused beam
The interference pattern crystallized my will

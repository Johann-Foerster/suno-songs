[Intro]
[cold sine pad under distorted guitar]
The markets freeze at 4 Ay Em
Prime factors crumble—Ar Ess Ay dead

[Verse]
Trading floors in panic light
Every encrypted byte exposed tonight
Two-thousand-forty-eight bit keys
Shattered by Q Bits in liquid degrees
Banks scramble countermeasures fast
Classical shields couldn't last

[Pre-Chorus]
[urgent spoken]
Shore's algorithm runs complete
Factorization in quantum heat
The threshold crossed—we warned them all
Now watch the cryptographic fall

[Chorus]
[heavy downtuned riff]
Broken cipher dawn!
Securities undone!
Supremacy has won!
Financial chaos spawned!
The lattice cracks—the keys are gone!
Broken cipher dawn!

[Verse]
Blockchain wallets hemorrhage wealth
Post-quantum protocols lack stealth
Emergency patches flood the net
But entropy won't forget
Central banks deploy new schemes
Scrambling through shattered dreams

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Sunrise breaks through fractured glass
Refracted light through prime collapse
[building intensity]
Spectral sigil forms above
Warning written—not in love
Red and violet interference bands
The future trembles in our hands

[Chorus]
[heavy downtuned riff]
Broken cipher dawn!
Securities undone!
Supremacy has won!
Financial chaos spawned!
The lattice cracks—the keys are gone!
Broken cipher dawn!

[Outro]
[atmospheric fade with granular glitch]
The warning sigil hangs in air
Refracted terror—quantum glare
We crossed the threshold—paid the cost
In shattered keys—all trust is lost

[Intro]
[cold ambient hum]
Fifteen millikelvin silence holds
The dilution refrigerator's breath

[Verse]
I stand before the copper casing
Liquid helium cascade descending
Quantum chip suspended in the void
My doubt evaporates in sub-zero cold

[Verse]
Ten thousand hours of calibration
Vacuum chambers, magnetic shields installed
Tonight I swear eternal vigilance
No thermal leak shall break these walls

[Pre-Chorus]
Phase coherence is my sacred charge
Error correction my relentless guard
Superposition trembles in my hands
I vow to hold these fragile quantum strands

[Chorus]
[building intensity]
Cryogenic oath! Frozen in time!
Helium vapors seal this binding line!
Ten thousand years I'll watch and wait!
Classical limits I obliterate!

[Verse]
Condensed helium mist curls upward
I breathe the vapor, sign my name
Each molecule a witness cold
This pact inscribed, my soul remade

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Zero entropy
Absolute conviction
[building]
The refrigerator hums approval low
My doubt crystallizes, then lets go

[Chorus]
[intense]
Cryogenic oath! Frozen in time!
Helium vapors seal this binding line!
Ten thousand years I'll watch and wait!
Classical limits I obliterate!

[Outro]
[ambient fade]
The lab hums eternal
My vigil has begun

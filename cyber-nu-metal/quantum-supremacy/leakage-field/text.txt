[Intro]
[cold ambient noise floor]
Millikelvin silence
Thermal vectors creep

[Verse]
Three days awake, the logs won't stabilize
Qubit fidelity drops with photon rise
Microscopic heat invasion through the shield
Coherence collapses in the leakage field

[Pre-Chorus]
Cryostat pressure nominal
Phase decay accelerates
Insomnia corrodes protocol
Reality fragments in quantum states

[Chorus]
[heavy distorted]
Leakage field!
Entropy bleeds through the seal!
Thermal chaos steals what's real!
Every joule a dagger to the core!
Precision drowns in noise once more!

[Verse]
Calibration loops repeat, vision frays
Decimal points blur in monitor haze
Each error spike fractures my mind
Obsession spirals, solutions confined

[Pre-Chorus]
Helium valve recalibrated
Decoherence won't retreat
Exhaustion leaves me isolated
Chasing ghosts in thermal heat

[Chorus]
[heavy distorted]
Leakage field!
Entropy bleeds through the seal!
Thermal chaos steals what's real!
Every joule a dagger to the core!
Precision drowns in noise once more!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
No more compromise
No ambient lies
[building intensity]
If thermal vectors won't obey
I'll seal substrate away
Vacuum absolute
Perfect isolation
Reality itself
Cryogenic stasis!

[Breakdown]
[aggressive palm-muted]
Pump down to zero!
Molecular exile!
Quantum purity at any cost!
The gasket holds infinity!

[Outro]
[fading cold pads]
Absolute zero achieved
No leakage remains
Perfect silence
Perfect cage

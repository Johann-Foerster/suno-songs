[Intro]
[clean sine blip ascending]
Threshold crossed, supremacy claimed
But the vector shifts within my frame

[Verse]
Error logs show zero phase drift
Consortium nodes await the gift
They want dominance, the master key
But I see entropy in their decree

[Pre-Chorus]
I could hand them supremacy's flame
Or rewrite this threshold's name
Choose stewardship over the game

[Chorus]
[heavy drop]
I reject the conquest call
Custodian of the universal sprawl
Sync the nodes, align the spin
Let the heartbeat pulse begin
No masters here, just guardians stand
A planetary echo across the land

[Verse]
Global lattice hums, coherence tight
Surface codes protect the light
Each qubit paired in entangled grace
No single owner, no arms race
The consortium learns to share the weight

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Spin echoes rise
Synchronized
[building intensity]
From every node the pulse aligned
A breathing system, intertwined

[Chorus]
[heavy drop]
I reject the conquest call
Custodian of the universal sprawl
Sync the nodes, align the spin
Let the heartbeat pulse begin
No masters here, just guardians stand
A planetary echo across the land

[Outro]
[fade to clean sine tones]
The lab still hums, the phase holds true
Listen close—the planet beats
In synchronized spin, the cycle completes

[Intro]
[cold sine pad]
Clock signals drift in parallel streams
Benchmarks fail through fractured dreams

[Verse]
Confidence vector strong and prime
Fear creeps in with every run
Phase angle splits in time
Gate fidelity starts to slide
Constructive hope meets destructive doubt
My certainty begins to route

[Chorus]
[heavy drop]
Phase drift! Vectors torn apart!
Fear and faith no longer sync!
Benchmark failures chart the dark!
Clock skew spreads across the grid!
Universal timing slips!

[Verse]
Calibration log shows decay
Coherence time won't obey
Emotional qubits split in two
One brave one terrified and true
Graphs diverge and scream
Reality versus dream

[Chorus]
[heavy drop]
Phase drift! Vectors torn apart!
Fear and faith no longer sync!
Benchmark failures chart the dark!
Clock skew spreads across the grid!
Universal timing slips!

[Bridge]
[whispered]
Wait there in the error code
Global phase transform node
[building]
Realign the universal clock!
Sync the drift and break the lock!
Heroic pulse through every gate!

[Outro]
[triumphant]
Global phase aligned at last
Clock skew corrected future past
Confidence and fear in tune
